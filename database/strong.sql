(1, 'January-15-2019 12:20:29', 'THE TENSION WEIGHTLIFTING TECHNIQUE', 'Fitness', 'Tom', 'p34.jfif', '                Yes, genetics matter. So does nutrition, your fat-to-muscle ratio, how many years youâ€™ve been lifting weights, if you sit throughout the day, and â€” ultimately â€“how much weight you can lift.\r\n\r\nBut letâ€™s assume all of those are equal, and yet, here you are, still sweating day-after-day at the gym and not looking like the other people putting in the same work.\r\n\r\nWeâ€™ve all been there and itâ€™s an awful feeling, but one that can be fixed with a simple adjustment. One of the biggest factors that determine whether or not youâ€™ll see the results you want comes down to two words: weightlifting technique.\r\n\r\nMore specifically, creating tension. If you want to start seeing your efforts pay off, itâ€™s time to learn that itâ€™s not always what exercises you do, but how you do them.\r\n\r\nWhy Tension Matters\r\nFor a moment, forget weightlifting technique and think bigger picture. We know that there are 3 primary factors that determine how much much muscle strength and size youâ€™ll build when you lift: metabolic stress, mechanical tension, and muscle damage. Letâ€™s focus on the first two because the third is a byproduct of the work you do. \r\n\r\nMetabolic stress refers to the burning sensation you feel in your muscles as you pump out rep after rep. You can increase the amount of metabolic stress you produce by performing more sets, or more reps inside of those sets.\r\nMechanical tension broadly refers to how engaged your muscle tissues are when you lift.\r\nPeople spend a mountain of time thinking about category number one. Youâ€™ve probably wondered many times about how many sets and reps you should perform, and when and how often you should change those numbers over time.\r\n\r\nMost people, however, donâ€™t spend nearly as much time on category two (tension), which is a huge missed opportunity. This is where weightlifting technique comes into play. \r\n\r\nâ€œTension and its twin, relaxation, are the alphas of strength and conditioning,â€ says Dan John, a world-renowned fitness coach and author of several books on training. â€œThey are the most important two concepts. And they are exact opposites of each other.â€  \r\n\r\nThe trouble with tension â€” like any weightlifting technique â€” is that it can be difficult to learn. Which also means itâ€™s challengingâ€”and time-consumingâ€”to coach. Many trainers wonâ€™t take the time to teach it.\r\n\r\nâ€œWhen Iâ€™m teaching someone to do a correct kettlebell swing, I first have to teach them to grip the ground with their big toe. For a person whoâ€™s new to lifting, that might take a day,â€ John explains.\r\n\r\nHe adds that each of the other key elements of the exercisesâ€”buttcheeks squeezed together, abs firmly braced, lats pulling back, and then making all of this to happen at onceâ€”takes days if not weeks to learn. â€œSo teaching someone the kettlebell swingâ€”which at the top, is basically a vertical plankâ€”might take the better part of a few months. And yet I see people teach that exercise and 72 others on the first day of a class.â€\r\n\r\nTo be fair to trainers, not everyone wants to take the time to learn any weightlifting technique. Itâ€™s not exactly as much fun as losing fat, building biceps, or seeing your abs pop. And a big part of a trainerâ€™s job is to make exercise fun to prevent you from being bored. After all,  making exercise enjoyable will keep you doing it and coming back for more, and thatâ€™s when results happen.   \r\n\r\nBut, hereâ€™s why youâ€™ll want to take a little time to master the tension weightlifting technqiue (while still making your workouts fun)â€”and how it can make every exercise you perform more effective.\r\n\r\nHow Your Weightlifting\r\nTechnique Prevents Injuries\r\nAnother secret smart trainers know: creating tension can help you fix bad biomechanics and reduce how much you are hurt.\r\n\r\nâ€œIâ€™d argue that a lot of what people call â€˜lack of mobilityâ€™ can be attributed not to lack of flexibility but to lack of stability, which you can establish through coaching tension,â€ says Tony Gentilcore, owner of CORE, a small-group training facility in Boston.\r\n\r\nHereâ€™s what he means. Letâ€™s say youâ€™re having trouble staying upright when you squat. Your torso leans forward as you descend. Lots of people will blame that on a lack of mobility in their thoracic spine (upper back). But thereâ€™s a good chance that whatâ€™s actually to blame is your core. Youâ€™re not stable enough in your midsection to descend as far as you should. If you learn how to create more tension in your core, then suddenly the â€œmobility issueâ€ goes away.\r\n\r\nHereâ€™s how it works. If youâ€™re an experienced lifter, perhaps youâ€™re familiar with the terms â€œkinetic chainâ€ and â€œenergy leaks.â€ If not, hereâ€™s a quick primer.\r\n\r\nThe kinetic chain refers to the bodyâ€™s joints (ankle, knee, hip, shoulder, etc.) working together. Think of your body as a cohesive unit. When you walk, for instance, itâ€™s just not your legs doing the work. Anyone thatâ€™s ever had a back injury knows this all too well because even the simplest (seemingly unrelated) movements can cause pain.\r\n\r\nAn energy leak occurs when thereâ€™s insufficient stiffness (a.k.a. tension) around one of those joints.\r\n\r\nSo letâ€™s say youâ€™re performing a back squat and your knees cave inward. Thatâ€™s an energy leak. And itâ€™s a problem because, not only does that leak put stress on the joints, it also fosters a muscle imbalance. When your knees cave in, your body asks the surrounding muscles to re-center your knee. Over time, youâ€™re strengthening one set of muscles at the expense of another. (Youâ€™re also burning metabolic fuel that could otherwise be put toward another rep.)\r\n\r\nMaybe thatâ€™s something you can get away with if you only ever use light resistance when you train. But as the weight gets heavier, the risk gets bigger.\r\n\r\nâ€œFor advanced guys, you might have 400-500 pounds on your back,â€ says strength coach Jason Ferruggia. â€œSo to minimize injury risk, youâ€™ve got to maintain full-body tension throughout the set.â€\r\n\r\nWhat does that mean? When you think of weightlifting technique, you usually just think about the muscles youâ€™re working. But thatâ€™s just part of the story. You need to prepare your entire body for a lift, and, oftentimes, itâ€™s the muscles you wouldnâ€™t even think about.\r\n\r\nStaying with the squat example, most people are worried about their knees or their back (or both). But creating â€œfull-body tensionâ€ often times starts in neither of those two places. Youâ€™ll begin with your grip on the bar and then focus on your breathing and abs, which is what actually protects your back from injury.\r\n\r\nWhen you take a big belly breath (think about filling your stomach with air so that if you have a belt around your natural waist you would feel it become tight), it creates a natural lifting belt that protects your spine. This is known as bracing your torso. (Hereâ€™s a story that explains how it works and how to do it. You can skip down to the section â€œThe Problem: Incorrect Breathingâ€ if you want to see it straight away.)\r\n\r\nSo in this case, tension is protective. Your grip creates tension that sends a signal to your brain saying, â€œIâ€™m about to lift heavy weight.â€ Thatâ€™s important. If you then â€œpullâ€ your elbows down and back (imagine someoneâ€™s hands trying to push your elbows up and you have to resist against them), youâ€™ll engage your lats, which also protect your spine. Then, when you take your belly breath, you add the final piece of full body tension, which will protect your spine. This type of approach can prevent an energy leak that causes your form to break down and injury to occur.\r\n\r\nJust as tension protects you when you squat, it keeps you safer when you perform other exercises. A shoulder thatâ€™s engaged is less likely to wind up in an unnatural position when you overhead press. Having your torso firmly braced will help protect your lower back when you deadlift.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned earlier, the heavier of a weight you use, the more important weightlifting technique and proper tension becomes. The same is true for the number of repsâ€”the more you perform, the more challenging it is.\r\n\r\nâ€œEvery rep beyond 5 or 6 or so becomes increasingly more difficult to do, so you open yourself up to more injury risk,â€ Ferruggia says. â€œThatâ€™s why I like low reps on the big lifts. Itâ€™s really hard to maintain that tension while maintaining good form. So a lot of times people say beginners should do high reps. No, itâ€™s the opposite.â€              '),
(2, 'January-15-2019 12:20:47', 'DO YOU NEED AMINO ACIDS?', 'Yoga', 'Tom', 'p33.jfif', 'Branched chain amino acids (BCAAs) are a collection of three amino acids with a side chain that is branched. They are leucine, isoleucine, and valine (usually in a 2:1:1 ratio).\r\n\r\nThey are marketed mostly to athletes during periods of caloric deprivation, as these BCAAs are found in all protein sources. Their niche lays in the fact that sometimes you only want these three amino acids and all the others merely add unwanted calories.\r\n\r\nLeucine itself is known to be an anabolic factor and signal for muscle protein synthesis, and in the presence of inadequate nutrition (youâ€™re eating less than normal) this anabolic signal appears to stall muscle cell loss.\r\n\r\nThis anabolic effect does, however, extend to most cell types rather than just muscle. While BCAAs tend to be high in leucine, all complete protein sources contain enough leucine to provide a benefit.\r\n\r\nWhen looking at studies, comparing BCAAs to no protein intake makes it appear that BCAAs do benefit you. However, the limited studies comparing BCAAs to another protein source showed that BCAAs were no better.\r\n\r\nWhile the nutritional label on BCAAs may not list any calories, this is because the FDA allows anything under 5 calories (per serving) to be listed as 0 calories.\r\n\r\nBCAAs may have a role in preserving skeletal muscle mass during periods of severe caloric deprivation, but that is not something most people experience (and again, can be mitigated by consuming protein). The decision to use BCAAs may come down to a decision between 30 calories and 120 calories.\r\n\r\nThe bottom line: BCAAs will save you some calories, but their benefits over other protein sources is marginal, at best.\r\n\r\nEssential Amino Acids (EAAs)\r\nEssential amino acids are in a grey area between BCAAs and whole protein sources, and rather than giving only the three BCAAs they give all amino acids that have the aforementioned essential status.\r\n\r\nThe most practical usage of essential amino acids would be to supplement the diet of a vegan who generally under-consumes protein and is not otherwise using protein supplementation. Additionally, they confer the same benefits as BCAAs, although with a slightly higher caloric content.\r\n\r\nPractically speaking, however, the previous choice between 30 and 120 calories has now become a pedantic 80 calories and 120 calories. Practical situations in which EAAs are useful are highly limited to times where every calorie becomes critical.\r\n\r\nThe bottom line: EAAs are useful if you have no source of protein. Otherwise, hard to see any additional benefit.\r\n\r\nGlutamine\r\nGlutamine gets special mention here due to its popularity as a standalone supplement.\r\n\r\nWhen looking at isolated muscle cells, glutamine introduction above normal levels appears to cause dose-dependent increases in muscle protein synthesis. It is from this information, as well as the clinical usage of glutamine in burn victims (to aid in tissue regeneration) that glutamine is marketed as a muscle building agent.\r\n\r\nAt this moment in time, glutamine for the purpose of building muscle tissue in healthy people is wholly unsupported. (Sorry supplement industry.) Glutamine deficiency, the prerequisite for glutamine actually building muscle, is probably more uncommon in nonclinical settings than scurvy.\r\n\r\nThat being said, because the intestines sequester glutamine so much the supplement does indeed make a good intestinal health supplement (which can also just be mimicked by protein sources with a high glutamine content such as casein).\r\n\r\nThe bottom line: Do not bother with a glutamine supplement. You will get enough via protein sources. However, it might help with intestinal health and your immune system'),

The 7-minute workout is real and it worksâ€¦at least, thatâ€™s what the mainstream media would have you believe. And yet, doesnâ€™t this feel a little played out? I mean, have we already forgotten about â€œ8-Minute Abs?â€ Itâ€™s been nearly 20 years since it was released, and during that time obesity rates have nearly doubled.\r\n\r\nHereâ€™s a disclaimer: I donâ€™t have a problem with the 7-minute workout. I take issue with setting unrealistic expectations that trick people into believing a â€œminimum effective doseâ€ can lead to maximum results. This is the foundation of frustration.\r\n\r\nNew scientific discoveries are capable of uncovering new information that alters what we believe and thought was true; in fact, it happens all the time. The problem is we oftentimes trust what we want to believe rather than seek to prove if itâ€™s true. Thatâ€™s the issue with the recent release of the 7-minute workout. Weâ€™ve been misled by a catchy title that has some benefits but falls short on long-term promises.\r\n\r\nThereâ€™s no denying that exerciseâ€”in any doseâ€”is good for your body. In fact, when I travel, Iâ€™m constantly settling for 10-15 minute workouts instead of my normal 30- to 60-minute session. And you can have a great workout in less than 10 minutes.\r\n\r\nBut donâ€™t confuse the part from the whole: it is very difficult (and unlikely) to build a healthy body by working out 7 minutes per day and only performing bodyweight exercises, which is the foundation of the 7-minute workout. And Iâ€™ll go on record that youâ€™d be hard pressed to find anyone that has. After all, if it only took 7 minutes to get into great shape, the struggle to lose fat would be less of an issue.\r\n\r\nBefore you start cranking out the â€œperfect workoutâ€ at home and expecting dramatic results or buy into the inevitable 7-minute session coming soon to a gym near you, hereâ€™s what you can really take away from the research, and what you can realistically expect to achieve if you follow this routine.\r\n\r\nFree Guide: How To Improve Your Squat, Deadlift, and Bench\r\nWhere the 7-Minute Workout Study Failed\r\nUnderstand that research in the exercise field oftentimes falls within two categories: Studies that use prior research to validate prior concepts or designs that test something new while building on previous research. The 7-minute workout is more of the former; it looked at the perceived benefits of a 7-minute workout and deduced many benefits based on research that was already completed.\r\n\r\nThat doesnâ€™t make the research bad or inaccurate, if not for one small problem: The studies used to â€œproveâ€ the concepts donâ€™t mirror the workout that is being lauded as the 7-minute fix for your body. Thatâ€™s like saying that because thereâ€™s research showing low carb diets help with weight loss that a diet with no carbs will guarantee that you will drop fat. It doesnâ€™t work like that. As always, the devil is in the details.\r\n\r\nIn the case of this circuit-training program, the claims outpace reality. Thatâ€™s why I reached out to Brad Schoenfeld, author of The Max Muscle Plan. Schoenfeld is one of the leaders in muscle-building research, and a guy who literally wrote the book on packing on muscle. Here are some of his takeaways:\r\n\r\nNot All Circuit Training is Equal\r\nThe general idea of the 7-minute workout is that you perform 12 bodyweight exercises as a circuit. This type of exercise is categorized as â€œhigh intensity circuit training.â€ No problem there, but once we moved beyond how to label the type of exercise thatâ€™s where the problems begin. â€œThe authors make big leaps that are not substantiated,â€ says Schoenfeld.\r\n\r\nRemember, the justification of this program is validated by prior research explaining why this type of workout will build muscle and burn fat. And yet, three of the four references cited are based on types of high intensity trainingâ€”not interval training. â€œAnd the one circuit training study they do cite by Murphy et al. 1992 used a protocol that was nearly 3 times as long as the one proposed by the authors,â€ says Schoenfeld.\r\n\r\nEven then, that study found a boost in EPOC (consider this your metabolism) that resulted in a whopping 25 additional calories burned. I donâ€™t know about you, but I donâ€™t consider 25 extra calories a fat-shredding workout.'),

They build full-body strength and muscle, and according to research, can even fix back pain. Hereâ€™s a guide to help you master the move in no time.\r\nIf youâ€™ve never tried to deadlift, you really should. In fact, just take the next 3 minutes to read the 5 points below. Theyâ€™ll reduce your fear of an exercise that is incredibly beneficial, regardless of your gender or fitness goal. And then youâ€™ll find a guide to performing them flawlessly.\r\n\r\nAnd if you already perform and love the deadlift, you can spend the same 3 minutes reading and learning why the exercise is even better than you thought. Or you can skip on ahead to the deadlift form guide. Your call.\r\n\r\nReady? Letâ€™s set a timer for 3 minutesâ€¦\r\n\r\nReason to Deadlift #1: Youâ€™re going to get\r\nway strongerâ€”and therefore live longer.\r\nThe deadlift is a true total body exercise that builds full body strength (both your lower and upper body will benefit). And getting stronger is NEVER a bad thing.\r\n\r\nIn fact, getting stronger is far better for you than you may think. Researchers have found a correlation between grip strength and mortality, as in those with stronger grips tend to live longer. And one thing you will definitely get from deadlifting is a strong grip.\r\n\r\n(Not to mention stronger quadriceps, hamstrings, forearms, traps, and glutes, just to name a few.)\r\n\r\nReason to Deadlift  #2: That\r\nstrength will come in handy\r\nthroughout your (now longer) life.\r\nThere are two types of people in the world: Those who struggle to move a couch, and those who deadlift.\r\n\r\nBut letâ€™s say you never move couches. At some point or another, youâ€™re going to need to pick something up off of the ground. When you do, youâ€™ll be far better suited to do so because you deadlift.\r\n\r\nThe deadlift takes a basic human movement (picking something up) and makes you far more capable at it. That means youâ€™ll be far less likely to get hurt.\r\n\r\nIn factâ€¦.\r\n\r\nReason to Deadlift #3: Deadlifts actually\r\nprotect you from lower back pain.\r\nHow many people do you know who complain about back pain?\r\n\r\nThatâ€™s right, seemingly everybody.\r\n\r\nA review of 28 studies found that, from age 30 onward, the percentage of people within an age group who are dealing with chronic low back pain increases with each passing year.\r\n\r\nSo here you are, avoiding deadlifts to save your back, but yet you still have lower back pain.\r\n\r\nWhy? Probably because youâ€™ve been avoiding deadlifts in the first place.\r\n\r\nDonâ€™t believe us? Consider that studies indicate that properly training the deadlift can outright fix low back pain.\r\n\r\nHow? By strengthening the spinal erectors, or the muscles that maintain the integrity of the spine. They travel the entire length of your spine, tucking under the lats and traps, and running all the way down to your lower back.\r\n\r\nAccording to research, the deadlift trains this musculature better than anything. Two studies looked at spinal erector activation during the deadlift, and found that the exercise induced high amounts of upper spinal erector activity in a way not seen with other exercises.\r\n\r\nThe studies also showed strengthening in the lower back.\r\n\r\nâ€œBut wait,â€ you say. â€œIâ€™m not really â€˜intoâ€™ weight training.â€\r\n\r\nThatâ€™s cool. And completely understandable. But before you say that weights arenâ€™t for you, letâ€™s just make sure you understand a few other things hereâ€¦\r\n\r\nReason to Deadlift #4: Weight training\r\nhelps you loseâ€”and keep offâ€”fat.\r\nThe stronger you are, the more lean body mass you carry.\r\n\r\nThe more lean body mass you carry, the higher your basal metabolic rate. Thatâ€™s the number of calories your body burns on itâ€™s own just to keep you aliveâ€”before factoring in things exercise and NEAT.\r\n\r\nOne study found that men who weight trained burned 350 more calories on average while just sitting around and watching television.\r\n\r\nSome claim that it takes years of lifting weights to achieve this effect, but research shows otherwise. One study found that just 16 weeks of strength training produced a noticeable lift in the resting metabolic rate of a group of men aged 50-65.\r\n\r\nAnd while people often think that cardio is king for keeping fat off (total myth, BTW), researchers who ran a cohort that encompassed more than 10,500 men across 12 years found that those who lifted weight gained less fat over the long haul.\r\n\r\nReason to Deadlift #5: Weight training\r\nimproves other aspects of your health, too.\r\nFor example, one study found that muscle mass was inherently protective against diabetes.\r\n\r\nMuscle also plays a crucial role if you ever have to recover from surgery or serious illness.\r\n\r\nWe could go on, but you get the point: Being strong is good. Having muscle is good. And deadlifts will help you build plenty of it.\r\n\r\nThat was a fun 3 minutes, right? We thought so too. Well, now that you know the value of deadlifts, letâ€™s show you how to do them properly so you never fear them againâ€¦\r\n\r\n\r\nProper Deadlift Form: How to\r\nFit the Move to Your Body Type\r\nMaybe youâ€™ve tried deadlifting in the past and thought the exercise just didnâ€™t feel right. If so, youâ€™re not alone.\r\n\r\nThe deadlift involves many muscles, all of your limbs, and every load-bearing joint (ankles, knees, hips and shoulders) in your body. There are a lot of variables at play. So having hard-and-fast rules about deadlift form is nearly impossible.\r\n\r\nYour body is your body. That seems like an obvious fact, yet itâ€™s one thatâ€™s often overlooked when it comes to form.\r\n\r\nFor example, two people who are the same height may have totally different torso and femur lengths.'),
(5, 'January-15-2019 12:23:09', 'THE VALSALVA MANEUVER', 'Weight Training', 'Zoe333', 'p30.jfif', 'Using a breathing technique called Valsalva when you lift will help you feel stronger and be safer. The only problem? Most gyms wonâ€™t teach it to you. Hereâ€™s why thatâ€™s BS, and how mastering the Valsalvaâ€”and the essential skill behind itâ€”can improve your deadlift max, protect your back, and even help your digestion.  \r\nMost fitness tips do not provide instant gratification. As much as people hate it, fitness â€” as a method of seeing results â€” is an endurance event. It takes a lot of reps and sets, sometimes across a span of years, to change your body. And while no workout will instantly slash fat or make you more muscular, there are a few techniques that â€” like magic â€” can have an immediate impact on how well you train and feel. The Valsalva maneuver is one of those techniques.\r\n\r\nWhen you learn about training, almost everything focuses on the usual suspects:\r\n\r\nHow much weight youâ€™ll use\r\nThe reps and sets\r\nThe exercise selection\r\nAnd maybe even what youâ€™ll wear to the gym\r\nAll of these are important. But all of these cover what you do. Notice that they all avoid how to do it.\r\n\r\nCorrect form is important, but so is how you breathe when you lift â€” and, in particular, learning to master whatâ€™s called the valsalva maneuver.\r\n\r\nIf this sounds crazy, well, youâ€™re not alone. Most people think the idea of â€œlearning how to breatheâ€ is like telling someone to learn how to blink. Itâ€™s instinctual and doesnâ€™t require a manual.\r\n\r\nAnd thatâ€™s where your lesson begins. Breathing is automatic, but how you breathe while youâ€™re sitting at a desk is not the same thing as how you should breathe with 300 pounds on your back (or while youâ€™re holding any amount of weight, for that matter).\r\n\r\nIn fact, the way you breathe on different exercises can make all the difference between a hurt back and feels-great back, or not seeing progress versus hitting a new PR.\r\n\r\nInterested? Hereâ€™s how learning the valsalva maneuver technique will change your entire training experience.\r\n\r\nThe Soda Can Test: How to\r\nKnow Your Spine is Safe\r\nYou might know the squat is one of the best exercises for developing strength and building muscle. You also probably think of it as a way to end up with a hurt lower back. That alone means a lot of people avoid squats â€” when in reality itâ€™s not the exercise thatâ€™s the problem; itâ€™s how youâ€™ve been taught to do the movement.\r\n\r\nâ€œEverybody tells you to inhale on the way down, and exhale on the way up,â€ says Mark Rippetoe, owner of the Wichita Falls Athletic Club and author of Starting Strength: Basic Barbell Training. â€œThat is complete and utter bullshit. If you do that, you will hurt yourself.â€\r\n\r\nNow, Rippetoe isnâ€™t suggesting you shouldnâ€™t breathe. What heâ€™s saying is that the typical breathing cue is incomplete and leaves out some vital details.\r\n\r\nWhat Rippetoe knows is that the Valsalva maneuver is what allows you to push, pull, squat, or deadlift any amount of weight without stressing your spine. And itâ€™s not just beneficial from a safety standpoint. Learn to do the Valsalva maneuver well, and the amount of weight you can use on any exercise will increase.\r\n\r\nâ€œWhen you Valsalva, youâ€™re protecting your spine,â€ says Dr. Belisa Vranich, clinical psychologist and author of Breathe: The Simple, Revolutionary 14-Day Program to Improve your Mental and Physical Health. â€œMost people donâ€™t understand that you have to take a big breath in to be able to protect your spine [when you lift].â€\r\n\r\nWhen you inhale deeply, you create whatâ€™s called intra-abdominal pressure. The term describes forces within your abdominal cavity, or the area surrounded by the muscles on the side of your abs (your obliques), your pelvic floor (on the bottom), diaphragm (on top), rectus abdominus (the area known as the six-pack), and several back muscles.'),

There is also clear relationship between protein and weight loss.\r\n\r\nHereâ€™s the thing:\r\n\r\nNOT ALL PROTEINS ARE CREATED EQUAL.\r\n\r\nQuality counts. But whatâ€™s the difference between protein and â€œhigh-quality protein?â€\r\n\r\nIt can be a confusing distinction and one that doesnâ€™t receive enough attention.\r\n\r\nThe good news: Distinguishing high-quality protein from lesser-quality protein is easier than you might think.\r\n\r\nYour high-quality protein sources\r\nIf you just want a list of high-quality protein sources, we have you covered. The top sources are:\r\n\r\nDairy products; milk, whey powders, cheese and cottage cheese, yogurt\r\nEggs\r\nSeafood and fish\r\nBeef\r\nChicken\r\nBison\r\nPork\r\nPea Protein\r\nSoybeans\r\nBlended meals (beans and rice)\r\nVegan protein powders with multiple protein sources\r\nIf you want to better understand why all proteins are not created equal, then keep reading.\r\n\r\nYou might notice that the majority of the high-quality options are from animal sources. Thatâ€™s simple because, by and large, animal proteins are of higher quality than their veggie-sourced counterparts. Youâ€™ll soon learn why.\r\n\r\nBut never fear, plant-based friends: you can still fill your diet with the protein you need even if you never want to put any animals in your mouth. Weâ€™ll show you how later in this post.\r\n\r\nWhat makes a protein â€œhigh qualityâ€?\r\nA high-quality protein really is a function of three things:\r\n\r\nprotein digestibility (i.e. â€œCan your body break it down?â€)  \r\namino acid content (i.e. â€œWhatâ€™s really inside the protein?â€)\r\nthe resulting amino acid availability to support metabolic function (i.e. â€œWill your body be able to use those amino acids the way you want it to?â€) .  \r\nThe process of digesting any food begins in your mouth when you chew. But protein is unique among the three major macronutrients in that your bodyâ€™s digestion of it truly begins in the stomach and continues into the small intestine.\r\n\r\nWithin those organs, acidic digestive juices, powerful enzymes, and other components fully break down intact proteins into smaller chains of amino acids, the building blocks of protein.\r\n\r\nBefore a chain can be absorbed into the bloodstream, it must be shortened into individual amino acids. Only then, when these amino acids hit the bloodstream, can they be transported to working tissues, reassembled into larger proteins that the body needs.\r\n\r\nThey may also be held for a short time with other amino acids in whatâ€™s referred to as an amino acid pool. The body can turn to this pool and take the exact amino acids it needs to create a larger protein molecule required for one function or another, and leave behind what it doesnâ€™t require at the moment.\r\n\r\n\r\nMORE PROTEIN ISNâ€™T ALWAYS BETTER. QUALITY COUNTS.\r\nWhile the process might appear cut-and-dry, itâ€™s not that simple. And like many processes within the body, it isnâ€™t 100 percent perfect.  In other words, less than 100 percent of the protein you consume will be digested, absorbed, and put to use.\r\n\r\nScientists can measure a proteinâ€™s digestibility in the lab is by monitoring nitrogen absorption and excretion. (Protein is the only macronutrient that contains nitrogen, which is why this works.)  The outcome of this test typically produces a digestibility score.\r\n\r\nProteins that are highly digestible receive scores close to 100% (digestible). Lower scores are less digestible. If you were to consume a protein with a digestibility score of 90%, then for every 10g you consumed, you would absorb 9g and excrete 1g.\r\n\r\nIn general, animal proteins â€” such as dairy, eggs, and meat â€” score highly. Vegetarian proteins typically score lower.\r\n\r\nBut thereâ€™s another wrinkle in the process. Your bodyâ€™s ability to absorb nutrients compared to its actual requirements donâ€™t always line up.\r\n\r\nAmino Acids: Whatâ€™s Inside Your Protein?\r\nEvery source of protein has a different amino acid profile. These amino acids â€” or the component parts that a protein will become when you digest it â€” are a big determinant of whether or not a protein is high quality.    \r\n\r\nYour body can produce many amino acids on its own. But there are some it canâ€™t make. They are:\r\n\r\nhistidine\r\nisoleucine\r\nleucine\r\nlysine\r\nmethionine\r\nphenylalanine\r\nthreonine\r\ntryptophan\r\nvaline\r\nThese are the â€œessential amino acids,â€ and you must get them through your diet.\r\n\r\nAny food that contains all nine essential amino acids is known as a â€œcomplete protein.â€\r\n\r\nWhy Animal-Based Protein\r\nis the â€œEasy Buttonâ€\r\n\r\n\r\nAnimal protein sources mimic the protein composition of human tissue. Which is why meat naturally offers a highly usable blend of amino acidsâ€”including all nine essential amino acids (with some exceptions, which weâ€™ll get to in a second).\r\n\r\nAs a result, we humans can use protein from an animal source in a very efficient manner.\r\n\r\nAnimal proteins range from the obviousâ€”beef, pork, chicken, eggs, and fishâ€”to fluid sources such as milk. All of these are high-quality protein sources that are highly bioavailable (your body can put them to use easily).'),

That means collagen is in your skin, hair, joints, bones, muscles, veins, and organs, explains Jonathan Valdez, R.D.N., owner of Genki Nutrition and a spokesperson for the New York State Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.\r\n\r\nMore than 30 percent of your bodyâ€™s structural protein is collagen, adds NYC-based registered dietitian Laura Cipullo, R.D., C.D.E.\r\n\r\nAll collagen is made up of amino acids, which are the building blocks of protein. Your body uses these amino acids to repair its tissues (think: muscles, bones, and joints), explains registered dietician Mary Ellen Phipps, M.P.H., R.D.N., owner of Houston-based Milk & Honey Nutrition. Basically, collagen is the glue that holds those tissues together and help them withstand stretch, Phipps says.\r\n\r\nSo it makes sense that products are trying to find ways to improve collagen, especially when you consider that collagen decreases when you get older.              \r\n\r\nLike almost everything, you do not need a supplement to get collagen.\r\n\r\nCollagen can be found in animal proteins like eggs, chicken, bone broth, and dairy, says Maggie Michalczyk, R.D.N. Your body will also naturally make collagen from certain amino acids and vitamins and minerals like vitamin A, vitamin C, and copper, she says. In fact, vitamin C is necessary for collagen formulation, so being deficient can harm your bodyâ€™s natural production.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe bodyâ€™s collagen synthesis naturally decreases as we age, which means that, over time, our bodies arenâ€™t producing collagen as quickly as they once were,â€ explains Valdez.\r\n\r\nAfter about 25 to 30 years of age, your collagen levels start dropping by about 1 percent per year, which means that our bodies arenâ€™t repairing themselves as fast as they once did, Michalczyk says.\r\n\r\nSome blame that decrease in collagen production for their achy joints, slower muscle recovery, and sensitive stomachs.\r\n\r\nâ€œAs the production of collagen decreases, some people anecdotally report symptoms like slower wound healing, greater instances of joint pain or an increase in frequency of broken bones,â€ says nutritional therapy practitioner Alexandra Rains, C.N.T, co-founder of Bonafide Provisions.\r\n\r\nOk, So Should I Take a Collagen Supplement?\r\nWhen you learn that collagen decreases over time, itâ€™s logical to conclude that, â€œOk, well Iâ€™ll just take a collagen supplement. Problem solved.â€\r\n\r\nUnfortunately itâ€™s not so simple.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe studies done on oral ingestion of collagen are very limited and thereâ€™s a lot of false information out there,â€ says Valdez.\r\n\r\nFor starters, thereâ€™s no research that shows that the collagen we consume automatically gets turned into the collagen in our tissues.\r\n\r\nQuick science refresher: Collagen, like all proteins, is made up of amino acids. The collagen you consume in a collagen powder is going to be broken down into those amino acids with the help of enzymes in the stomach, says Keri Gans, M.S., R.D.N.\r\n\r\nThatâ€™s where we lose control of the process.

Start Here\r\nIf you canâ€™t do any pull-ups, odds are youâ€™ll blame it on your lack of back strength. To become stronger, you might start doing countless 1-arm rows and other dumbbell or barbell exercises.\r\n\r\nWhile those exercise will make you stronger (and are a part of the solution), they wonâ€™t guarantee that youâ€™ll be able to do more pull-ups. Thatâ€™s because pull-ups arenâ€™t just about your back.\r\n\r\nEVEN IF YOU HAVE A REALLY STRONG BACK, YOU CAN STRUGGLE WITH PULL-UPS IF YOU HAVE A WEAK CORE.\r\n\r\nCore stiffness, or being able to create tension throughout your torso, is a key part of successfully doing a pull-up.\r\n\r\nYour shoulder blades are connected to your torso. A stiff, stable core gives your arms something strong to pull on. And that can have a massive impact on your ability to lift your body.\r\n\r\nSo if you are struggling with your pull-upsâ€”or canâ€™t do a pull-up at allâ€”train your core with these moves.\r\n\r\n(If you prefer to watch all tips, hereâ€™s a video breaking down a lot of the progressions weâ€™ll discuss today. In it, youâ€™ll see my friend and fellow coach Tony Gentilcore demonstrating a lot of the moves discussed here.)\r\n\r\nHollow Body Holds\r\n\r\n\r\nStart by lying on the floor. Lift your arms overhead (biceps in line with your ears), keeping your elbows straight.\r\n\r\nCross your hands and your ankles. Then press your hands and ankles into each other to create tension, and lift up into the hollow body position.\r\n\r\nLetâ€™s talk about that term â€œhollowâ€ for a second. You might hear it and think: â€œbelly button to spine.â€ DONâ€™T DO THAT.\r\n\r\nIn a good hollow position, your abs are securely braced, as if they were about to take a punch. Take a breath in and squeeze. If anything, your abs will move slightly outward.\r\n\r\nStart by holding a hollow body position while pressing your hands into each other and pressing your ankles into each other. This builds some of the body tension related to the position of hanging from a bar.\r\n\r\nHold this position for 5 seconds or 2-3 breaths per rep, maintaining as much head-to-toe tension as you can (more on how to create tension). Take a 5-second break, then repeat for 5-6 reps per set. Over time, you can increase the duration of your holds. If you can maintain tension for a full minute, thatâ€™s really good.'),

These days, coal â€” or activated charcoal, to be exact â€” is offered in health stores, smoothies, and supplements as a â€œcure-allâ€ cleanser for a variety of health ailments.\r\n\r\nWhile most cleanses or detoxes have no science behind them (primarily because most prey on fear and donâ€™t deliver any real health benefit) activated charcoal is a different nature. There is reason to believe that charcoal could help cleanse your body because of different uses in emergency rooms. \r\n\r\nBut, believe it or not, research shows that slipping random amounts of activated charcoal into products might be worse than your run-of-the-mill miracle cleanse. \r\n\r\n\r\nDoes Activated Charcoal Work?\r\nThe rise of activated charcoal as a health cure starts in the medical community. Itâ€™s used in emergency rooms â€” quite effectively, might I add â€” to help people fight drug overdoses (oftentimes from OTC meds like acetaminophen).\r\n\r\nCharcoal helps prevent the spread of toxins from overdosing to try and limit the danger and risk to your body. Thatâ€™s great for dangerous and scary situations, but supplement manufacturers took it one step further and suggested that charcoal could prevent the spread of all toxins in your body. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, emergency situations do not directly apply to general use. And there are a few reasons why taking active charcoal wonâ€™t help detox your body or rid you of toxins.\r\n\r\nWhen activated charcoal is given in the ER, the standard dose is about 25 to 50 grams. If you look at the most â€œpopularâ€ activated charcoal products on the market, the dose is 250 milligrams. That means youâ€™re receiving â€” at most â€” about 100x less the amount you need to â€œdetox.â€ And, typically, the dose needs to be given as soon as possible. \r\n\r\nThe Risks of Activated Charcoal\r\nAn article on CNN showed that even if the activated charcoal is doing its job, it can be a very bad thing. \r\n\r\nYou see, activated charcoal works by binding to ingredients (like when it binds to acetaminophen) and preventing it from spreading in your body. But, itâ€™s not selective. The charcoal doesnâ€™t know to bind only to the bad. It just knows to bind. That means the charcoal could be stripping your body of the good nutrients it needs.\r\n\r\nSo products that are loaded with vitamins and minerals and activated charcoal are essentially worthless.

And itâ€™s worth your attention.\r\n\r\nThe spice gets its coloring from a compound called curcumin, which is the real secret behind all of the alleged health benefits of turmeric. The University of Maryland Medical Center found that curcumin can help to improve chronic pain by suppressing inflammatory chemicals in the body, an additional study found that it reduces pain in those with osteoarthritis.\r\n\r\nBefore you start making curry or bombing turmeric/curcumin shots at your local juice bar, there are a few things you need to know. (You always know a trend is hot when coffee shops are testing it in their fancy drinks and youâ€™ll see â€œgolden milkâ€ products everywhere.)\r\n\r\nhow to use turmeric\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to turmeric, thereâ€™s a bit of a bait-and-switch effect. Just because something is good does not mean that any amount will make you feel better. Curcumin can work, but like any supplement, how you take it â€” and how much you use â€” matters most.\r\n\r\nThe Benefits of Turmeric (And Curcumin)\r\nResearch on curcumin is making it harder and harder to deny its benefits. Most supplements are as reliable as my Magic 8-ball. (Everyone under 30 is currently Googling â€œWhat is a Magic 8-ball?â€). Lots of hype, but once tested under the rigors (and typically unbiased nature) of science, the outlook is not so good.\r\n\r\nBut, thatâ€™s where curcumin is breaking the mold.\r\n\r\nThereâ€™s already substantial research showing curcumin can help with everything from inflammation, to fighting pain (as effective as 2000 mg of acetaminophen), and might be effective at helping prevent diseases like prostate cancer. \r\n\r\nA team of Chinese researchers performed a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to assess curcuminâ€™s effect on blood lipids of people at risk for cardiovascular disease and found that curcumin significantly lowered low-density lipoproteins (the â€œbadâ€ cholesterol) and triglycerides (another thing that most people want less of in their bloodstream). \r\n\r\nHow to Use Turmeric (And Curcumin)\r\nThe catch with the benefits above? Sprinkling turmeric (as a means of getting curcumin) into your coffee, on your meals, or eating more Indian food is not going to make a big impact. Thatâ€™s like sprinkling fairy dust on your shoulders and thinking youâ€™ll grow wings and fly (sorry, but itâ€™s true).\r\n\r\nThe potency of what is tested in the research is not anywhere near what you would add to your favorite dish or latte.\r\n\r\nIf you want any benefit from curcumin, youâ€™ll need to take a concentrated dose of anywhere from 500 mg (for lowering triglycerides) to 2,000 mg (reducing pain, similar to taking Tylenol), depending on what aspect of your health youâ€™re trying to improve.\r\n\r\nAnd, unless youâ€™re using an entire container of turmeric spice in your meal, you wonâ€™t get anywhere near that from food.\r\n\r\nJust as important, the absorption of curcumin in turmeric is very poor. That doesnâ€™t mean all hope is lost, but it does mean you need to take with specific foods or add additional ingredients to help your body experience all of the benefits.\r\n\r\nThe â€œeasy button?â€ Instead of eating or drinking turmeric, take an extract that has exactly what your body needs.\r\n\r\nAccording to examine.com, hereâ€™s what you can do to maximize the effectiveness of curcumin:\r\n\r\nTo supplement curcumin with piperine, take 500 mg of the former with 20 mg of the latter, thrice a day (i.e., 1,500 mg of curcumin and 60 mg of piperine per day).\r\nTo supplement BCM-95Â®, a patented combination of curcumin and essential oils, take 500 mg twice a day (i.e., 1,000 mg/day).\r\nTo supplement MerivaÂ®, a patented combination of curcumin and soy lecithin, take 200â€“500 mg twice a day (i.e., 400â€“1,000 mg/day).');

Most of them having nothing to do with fitness and nutrition. But my nutrition blunders run especially deep. \r\n\r\nIâ€™ve done everything from waking up twice in the middle of the night to drink protein shakes (gotta eat every 3 hours, right?) to slugging 20-30g of BCAAs throughout the day to â€œstay anabolicâ€ (this still feels like my â€œpet rockâ€ moment).\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to carb-loading, Iâ€™ve experimented with extremes: Iâ€™d wake up 2 hours prior to my workout and eat about 100-150g of carbohydrates. (Think: Two bowls of oatmeal + fruit + 2 slices of bread just to make sure my glycogen stores were â€œfully loadedâ€ to build muscle.) And I once avoided carbs completely, because fasted exercise burns more fat, right? (Nope!)\r\n\r\nThe truth is always more about sustainable behaviors than trying to â€œhackâ€ your body. For instance, fasted cardio does not burn more fat, but if you feel better doing it, then go for it. And carbs can help build more muscle, but you donâ€™t need to eat yourself silly.\r\n\r\nStill, the question remains for most:\r\n\r\nShould you eat carbs before a workout?\r\nFrom a scientific standpoint, research suggests a little bit of carb-loading can be a great thing for your workout performance.\r\n\r\nThe study, which was published in the Journal of Applied Physiology, compared endurance performance when consuming different amounts â€” and types â€” of carbohydrates.\r\n\r\nThe high-carb group ate 1.5g/kg of bodyweight before completing 90 minutes of intense exercise (think: a long run). This group saw better performance and were able to maintain their intensity for a longer period of time, whereas the lower-carb group had better fat oxidation, but were quicker to fatigue.\r\n\r\nLooking at the results, it was a little murky to determine if the type of carbohydrate (low vs. high glycemic index) made any difference.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen to Carb Load\r\nIf youâ€™re going to do long-lasting activity (especially endurance-type exercise, like running, biking, etc.) and performance is your goal (running longer, faster, and experiencing less fatigue), than pre-workout carbs is a better approach than avoiding carbs or going for a lower-carb meal.\r\n\r\nIn general, the longer the activity, the greater the â€œneedâ€ for carbs to help boost your workout.\r\n\r\nBut remember: if â€œforcingâ€ your carbohydrate intake before a workout means you donâ€™t work out, or makes you feel sick to your stomach, then donâ€™t do it. Carb loading isnâ€™t worth it if the meal that disrupts your workout.'),
(13, 'January-16-2019 10:04:22', 'SHOULD I CUT OUT ALCOHOL TO GET RID OF FAT?', 'Bootcamp', 'Xerox121', 'p22.jfif', 'First, Iâ€™ll toast you to a good question here. (Iâ€™m drinking green tea right now, but feel free to have a sip of whatever you wish.) When people ask â€œdoes alcohol make you fat,â€ or â€œshould I stop drinking to lose weight,â€ the answer is complex, but can be summed up with:\r\n\r\nNo, you donâ€™t have to ditch alcohol to lose fatâ€¦\r\nBUT, if you do cut out drinking, it might help.\r\nAlcohol And Weight Loss: Itâ€™s Complicated\r\nLetâ€™s start with the first point here. From a metabolic perspective, alcohol and your body have a weird relationship. Thereâ€™s actually been a lot of research into it over the years because itâ€™s so surprising.\r\n\r\nNumerous studies, both observational and in controlled settings, have shown that people can consume light to moderate amounts of alcohol and not necessarily gain weight. (Moderate drinking is defined as 1 drink a day for women and no more than 2 drinks a day for men.)\r\n\r\nAn infographic showing what one standard alcoholic drink looks like\r\n\r\nPart of this may be due to alcoholâ€™s unique effect on the body. Your body canâ€™t store alcohol and the 7 calories per gram it delivers. (Yup, it does have calories â€” more per gram than carbs and protein, but less than fat.) So instead the body fast-tracks that booze through your system.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, a high percentage of calories from alcohol get burned up by your metabolism through a process called the thermic effect of food (TEF). The thermic effect of alcohol is about 22.5%, which puts it on par with protein (which has a TEF of 25-30%) and well ahead of carbs (6-8%) and fat (2-3%).\r\n\r\nAll of which is to say: Alcohol on itâ€™s own wonâ€™t necessarily make or break your weight loss goals.\r\n\r\nâ€œIf you enjoy a few drinks during the week, it is still possible to have a highly successful fat loss journey,â€ says Born Fitness Head Nutrition Coach Natalie Sabin.\r\n\r\nNow for the butâ€¦\r\n\r\nWhy Alcohol Might Make You Fat\r\nJust because your body doesnâ€™t store alcoholâ€™s calories, it doesnâ€™t mean you (and your fat cells) get off scot-free.\r\n\r\nWhen your body is processing those calories from all those hoppy IPAs, or just one more glass of wine, they take the place of other calories you could be burning â€” like the bacon double cheeseburger you had on the way home from the bar. With beer calories taking its place in the metabolic line, the burgerâ€™s calories become part of you (and your belly).\r\n\r\nIn fact, some research would lead you to believe that the problem isnâ€™t necessarily the alcohol itself. Itâ€™s what can come along with drinking. You know, like nachos. Or two dozen wings. Or a box of Totinoâ€™s Pizza Rolls if itâ€™s 2 a.m. and youâ€™re in college.\r\n\r\nâ€œMany folks who drink alcohol also have a tendency to eat more,â€ Sabin says.\r\n\r\nA review published in Physiology & Behavior backs her up on this. It found that, sure enough, drinking before or during a meal tends to increase food intake.\r\n\r\nAlso, note that even though your body canâ€™t store alcohol, it can (and does) store the calories mixed with it â€” like the 83g of sugar in a frozen margarita.\r\n\r\nSo What Should You Do?\r\n1. Examine how much youâ€™re drinking currently. For some this can be very eye-opening on itâ€™s own. You might see that the â€œbeer or twoâ€ you have â€œnow and thenâ€ is actually â€œa couple drinks every night, plus about a dozen on the weekend.â€ Remember, the studies mentioned previously involved light to moderate drinking â€” i.e. one drink per day for women, two for men. Drinking more than that is conclusively not good. Heavier drinking is associated with weight gain and increased waist circumference, as well as poor health. Excessive alcohol consumption is the third-leading cause of premature death in the U.S. If your drinking exceeds that one to two drinks per day guideline, then yeah, cutting back (or going dry) likely will help you lose fat.\r\n\r\n2. Pay attention to what else you do when you drink. If your occasional cocktail with friends is just that â€” a cocktail â€” then the caloric load probably isnâ€™t all that significant. But if your drinks seem to come with a late night pizza chaser, you might have an issue on your hands. Here again, cutting out drinks might help your fat loss.\r\n\r\n3. Letâ€™s say your drinking (and appetite) is under control, but you still arenâ€™t losing fat. And letâ€™s say your drink-per-day is a must-have. If thatâ€™s the case, you could try and offset the calories by trimming elsewhere. For example, a glass of wine is around 120 calories. A typical beer is about 150 calories (although those heavier microbrews that are so popular nowadays can be double that). Cut out 30 to 40g of carbs from somewhere else, and pay attention to any changes. â€œRemember, to get rid of fat you need to create a calorie deficit,â€ Sabin says. â€œThat means burn more calories than you are consuming â€” whether thatâ€™s eating OR drinking.â€'),
(14, 'January-26-2019 07:47:52', 'NUTRITION HOW TO BUILD MUSCLE ON A VEGETARIAN DIET', 'Fitness', 'jazeb', 'p21.jfif', 'Vegetarian Diet Muscle: Start with Calories\r\nYour first step is to figure out your â€œmaintenance level,â€ or the number of calories you must eat to keep your weight consistent. To do that:\r\n\r\nIdentify your goal weight. Think â€œwhere you want to be,â€ not â€œwhere you are.â€\r\nâ€¨Use that figure to calculate an estimate of your daily intake using this equation: goal weight x (workout hours per week + 9.5) = daily number of calories\r\nTrack how much you eat. Online logs like MyFitnessPal can be helpful.\r\nMonitor your intake and your scale weight for a couple of weeks. (Weigh yourself first thing in the morning, after youâ€™ve went to the bathroom but before you eat or drink anything.)\r\nIf your body weight holds steady, youâ€™ll know that youâ€™ve accurately hit your maintenance number.\r\n\r\nIf youâ€™re losing weight, you can bump up calories. Add about 100 per day across a week â€” so, if you were eating 2000 calories per day last week, youâ€™d bump up to 2100 calories per day this week.\r\n\r\nIf you find youâ€™re gaining weight, do the opposite. Drop a hundred calories per day.\r\n\r\nWhen you reach a number that keeps your weight consistent, voila! Youâ€™re at the maintenance level.\r\n\r\nBut if your goal is to add muscle, you canâ€™t just stop there. To gain muscle, you need to eat more calories than you burn. How many more?\r\n\r\nLetâ€™s say you are an intermediate level lifter, meaning that you have been training for a few years.\r\n\r\nIf you are a woman or a smaller guy, youâ€™re probably going to want to eat an extra 100 to 200 calories above your maintenance amount.\r\nIf you are a larger, taller guy, youâ€™ll want to focus on an extra 200 to 300 calories.\r\nThis should result in you gaining one to two pounds per month. Itâ€™s a rough guideline, but one that will cover most people (although not everybody).\r\n\r\n[Ed. note: Could you gain more muscle than this? Sure. But this is a realistic rate of growth. Donâ€™t buy into promises that sound great on paper but will only leave you frustrated and want to quit.]\r\n\r\nFrom there, youâ€™ll want to monitor your weight and ask yourself: Am I gaining at the rate of weight that I want? If the answer is â€œyes,â€ then great. But if â€œno,â€ then continue to bump up your intake incrementally.\r\n\r\nHow Much Protein, Fat, and\r\nCarbs Do Vegetarians Need?\r\nAn array of fruits, vegetables, and protein options.\r\n\r\nLetâ€™s imagine that youâ€™ve determined how many calories you need to gain muscle. For the sake of keeping the math easy, letâ€™s say you need 3,000 calories per day.\r\n\r\nFrom there you can budget your macronutrients, or how many grams of protein, fat, and carbs you should aim for in a day. Do it in this order:\r\n\r\n1. Start with protein. Note that your protein intake will not actually be based on your total energy intake. Your target protein number should be based on how much lean body mass you have. [Ed. note: â€œLean body massâ€ is the weight of everything in your body that isnâ€™t fat â€” muscle tissue, bone, etc.]\r\n\r\nMost people donâ€™t have an easy way to calculate that accurately. So, instead, a good surrogate number to use for calculating protein is your goal body weight (If you are 180 pounds and want to weigh 200 pounds, then that is your goal weight). Multiply that weight by .8 to 1.0, and youâ€™ll have your target protein intake in grams.\r\n\r\nYou can eat more than that, but you donâ€™t need to. The times when you might want to consume more protein would be if you are gaining weight too quickly because you are hungry all the time. Protein is pretty filling, and going above your bodyweight-based target may help you feel fuller longer.\r\n\r\n2. Next up, calculate fat. Letâ€™s go back to the example of 3,000 calories per day with a goal weight of 200 pounds. That means you want 200 grams of protein per day. That equals 800 calories from protein (since protein is 4 calories per gram). You have 2,200 calories remaining for fat and carbohydrates.\r\n\r\nA good range for fat in your diet is anywhere between 20% and 40% of total calories from fat (Note: exceptions do exist, such as if you choose to follow a ketogenic diet.). For the 3,000 calories-per-day example, hereâ€™s what it would look like:\r\n\r\nGoal weight: 200 pounds\r\nâ€¨Protein: 200 grams\r\nFat calculation: 20-40%\r\nIf 20% of 3,000 calories = 600 calories from fat (or 600/9* = 67 grams of fat/day)\r\nâ€¨If 40% of 3,000 calories = 1,200 calories from fat (or 1,200/9 = 133 grams of fat/day)'),

But I donâ€™t want to send any traffic to that site because that would only perpetuate the damage thatâ€™s been done. This isnâ€™t about whether kale is healthy or not (it is), this is about a bigger issue and one that is slowly but surely tearing at the seams of health content.\r\n\r\nSo Iâ€™m drawing the line and doing what I rarely do: criticizing the specific work of another journalist. And it wonâ€™t be pretty or nice.\r\n\r\nThe author argues that kale makes the so-called fat list because,\r\n\r\nâ€œKale is barely edible until itâ€™s sprinkled with raisins and drizzled with salad dressing.â€\r\n\r\nBy that reasoning, technically every food will make you fat and we just stop eating.

The problem is the article leverages â€œscienceâ€ and pull-quotes in a misleading context that makes these foods seem like they might be bad.\r\n\r\nThey are not.\r\n\r\nIf we are to follow the advice of this article, we should now avoid fruits, vegetables, nuts, gluten-free foods, veggie juice, grains, and anything that isnâ€™t cooked.\r\n\r\nAs the author is quick to assert, â€œFoods that pack nutritional benefits may also pack on the pounds.â€\r\n\r\nReally?\r\n\r\nGuess what? Itâ€™s not just foods with â€œnutritional benefits.â€ Overeating anything will pack on pounds. So why steer people away from foods that have so many health benefits?\r\n\r\nI donâ€™t know when it happened, but weâ€™ve made eating nearly impossible and are creating eating disorders in people who have orderly eating habits.\r\n\r\nOn one side we have people saying, â€œDonâ€™t eat these healthy foods because they have too many calories and theyâ€™ll make you fat.â€\r\n\r\nOn the other side, we have people saying, â€œAvoid these foods and eat as much of you want from the â€˜approvedâ€™ list and youâ€™ll be just fine.â€\r\n\r\nBoth arguments are flawed.\r\n\r\nThis article is everything that is wrong with the health and fitness industry. Thatâ€™s why I need to call out the offenders for allowing this crap to be published. A line must be drawn.\r\n\r\nThis wasnâ€™t some blog. It was a major magazine doing an even more major disservice. And they should be embarrassed for publishing this food-shaming post. Hereâ€™s why: Writing health content comes with a social responsibility. People will read this and instead of consulting with a nutritionist or doctor, theyâ€™ll treat it as gospel. Maybe not everyone, but enough people that it will impact eating behaviors in a very dangerous way.\r\n\r\nSo if youâ€™re unwilling to respect and acknowledge that responsibility then you just shouldnâ€™t be creating health content. You want to know why people are frustrated by diets and workouts?\r\n\r\nBecause of advice (like whatâ€™s found in the kale article) thatâ€™s confusing, damaging, and creates a bad relationship with food.\r\n\r\nMost people donâ€™t have a background in fitness or nutrition. They read lists like the one in the kale article and trust the â€œreputableâ€ sources.\r\n\r\nI have no doubt that the editors of the article would defend their decision by saying readers should â€œread between the linesâ€ and understand context. The only line I read was, â€œthese 11 foods will make you fat.â€\r\n\r\nAre you trying to help people or just earn more page views?\r\n\r\nI hope the traffic was worth it because each click of this page led to another person frustrated and confused about what they are supposed to eat and what to believe.\r\n\r\nSo instead of continuing to castigate the stupidity, letâ€™s do something about it and provide diet advice that will empower rather than terrify and confuse.'),

But saying â€œeat lessâ€ obviously isnâ€™t that simple, and itâ€™s those instructions alone that do plenty of damage.\r\n\r\nWITH DIETING ITâ€™S MORE EFFECTIVE TO WIN AT A SMALLER GAME THAN TO LOSE AT A BIGGER GAME.\r\n\r\nThe reason is in the process it takes to do so. Eating less usually means changing habits, such as what you eat, when you eat, or how much you stress about each and every meal. So eating less really isnâ€™t just eating less; itâ€™s making more decisions that trigger a series of reactions.\r\n\r\nItâ€™s those reactions where fat loss usually fails. Itâ€™s the rules, poor decisions, and demonizing of certain foods that make simple concept (eat less) the reason why people generally hate diets.\r\n\r\nTell someone not to eat a burger, and they might believe that removing one food they love will trigger weight loss. The truth: that removal will do more harm than good, especially when you realize that burgers (or really any food) can be a part of an effective diet plan.\r\n\r\nInstead, the most effective diet programs donâ€™t settle for cliches (eat less, move more), or even scapegoats (gotta be the carbs, right?), instead itâ€™s about simplifying the lifestyle factors that make it easier to understanding how fat loss works.\r\n\r\nThatâ€™s a real ingredient that is most often overlooked, and the backbone of Fat Loss Happens on Monday, a new book by Josh Hillis. If you want to take a new and more effective approach to weight loss, here are just a few of the principles that will make the process more doable and less of a headache.\r\n\r\nFat Loss Nutrition: Time to Choose\r\nOn of the biggest issues with most plans is the inflexibility. Quite simply, you have too many rules that force you to take a plan that doesnâ€™t really fit how you eat and live.\r\n\r\nA smarter approach is to look at your day-to-day habits and the build the plan around you, since making a diet fit your life is a big part of making sure itâ€™s successful. Letâ€™s take on of the most common problems as an example: your most difficult meal\r\n\r\nThe Problem: Mealtimes and Obstacles\r\nDespite the surge in snacking behavior, most people still base their days around the concept of eating three meals per day.\r\n\r\nLetâ€™s say Bill has a hard time figuring out how to â€œget time for breakfastâ€, which becomes problematic because he repeatedly blows his lunch because heâ€™s starving by the time he gets there. (Sounds familiar, right?)\r\n\r\nOr Amy might feel breakfast and lunch are easy because she has a routine, but the wheels come off the wagon at dinner.\r\n\r\nAnd Suzy might have no problem with breakfast and dinner, but work meetings often run through lunch and thatâ€™s where she struggles.\r\n\r\nAll of these three clients have very different issues hitting their meal plan, and it would be silly for each of them to work on the same thing.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, they all feel like they are â€œfailing at fat lossâ€ and they go searching for another diet, another superfood, another magic workout. But another diet or workout isnâ€™t going to solve the issues they have with food.\r\n\r\nEssentially, all of their issues are strategy issues.  They need to play the game of making the â€œproblem mealâ€ work.'),

Eat a big meal to start the day and everything will be ok. I published the advice in three books, referenced the smartest minds in nutrition, and the tip was generally accepted as â€œthe right thingâ€ to do for your health.\r\n\r\nTurns out the â€œright thingâ€ really depends on whether you want to eat early in the morning. Thatâ€™s because two recent studies found that eating breakfast has no direct impact on weight loss. Weâ€™re not talking observational studies, like many done prior. This was a direct comparison of an early meal versus no early meal. And the results had a simple message:    \r\nIn the study, which looked at more than 300 people, participants were split into 2 groups. One ate breakfast and the other did not. While there were some small differences, the bottom line was that there was no significant difference in weight loss between the breakfast eaters and the breakfast skippers.

That just goes to show you how many enjoyable, healthy meals you might be missing. Feel free to blame the diet industry, but the reality is you can easily transform some of your favorite foods into a healthy option, which is exactly what weâ€™ve done with this breakfast pita.\r\n\r\nIn this healthy recipe, you mix foods with a lot of flavorâ€”cough, coughâ€¦sausage and cheeseâ€”with those that tend to be more bland and boringâ€”egg whites and spinach. Thatâ€™s the secret to success in any eating plan: make it flavorful and enjoyable so you look forward to your meals.\r\n\r\nItâ€™s not about whether you are on a â€œdietâ€ or not; itâ€™s about making nutrient-dense food taste great while also fueling your body with what it needs to lose fat and gain lean muscle.\r\n\r\nWant to enjoy this breakfast pita every day? You can because itâ€™s full of protein and packed with nutrients. Best of all? Our breakfast pita can be ready to eat in less than 10 minutes, meaning itâ€™s perfect for your on-the-go lifestyle.\r\n\r\nWhy itâ€™s a Healthy Recipe\r\nIn order to keep the calories low and the flavor high, we substituted the fat in an egg yolk for the fat in chicken sausage and cheese. And if you want more calories, simply keep the egg yolks.\r\n\r\nThe chicken sausage is a great alternative to pork sausage because itâ€™s lower fat. [Note: fat isnâ€™t bad, but it is calorically dense. This way you save calories in one place and can add flavor in another.] By sautÃ©ing the onions and spinach in the sausage first, youâ€™re adding flavor and micronutrient-rich vegetables.\r\n\r\nWe canâ€™t promise instant bicep growth like Popeye, but spinach has anti-inflammatory, anti-cancerous phytochemicals that also support eyesight. The whole-wheat pita is a great way to add fiber and complex carbohydrates to your meal. Make sure to check the ingredients in your pita, or any bread or wrap for that matter. Look for the word â€œwholeâ€ before he first ingredient. Words like â€œenriched,â€ â€œwheatâ€ and â€œmulti-grainâ€ can fool you.

To some (such as certain followers of the Paleo movement), rice is a demon food that should be avoided like the plague.\r\n\r\nYet in some cultures that exhibit immaculate biomarkers of health and low obesity rates, it has been a dietary staple for centuries. What gives?\r\n\r\nI ate 5 cups of rice last night for dinner. Iâ€™m also close to 5% body fat, so I can tell you what side of the fence Iâ€™m on. I think sugar, high fructose corn syrup, trans fats, and high omega-6 vegetable oils do more to cause insulin resistance, diabetes, and obesity than my pal white rice.\r\n\r\nBut most of us donâ€™t want to give up our beloved junk foods, so we have to blame something. White rice is as easy of a target as any. So in order to help you determine whether carbsâ€“or riceâ€“should be a part of your diet, Iâ€™ve developed a simple three-step system to help you figure out your nutrition needs.\r\n\r\nStep 1: Do You Need Starchy Carbs?\r\nA core problem in the fitness industry is trying to slot everyone into one universal diet system. It just doesnâ€™t work that way my friends.\r\n\r\nIntense exercise changes the way your body processes nutrients, and your internal physiological, metabolic, and hormonal environment for 24 to 48 hours. That means athletes and regular exercisers have very different dietary needs than sedentary populations.\r\n\r\nBeyond any scientific debate, thatâ€™s really just pure common sense. So the first step in this carb selection story is to assess how many carbohydrates you really need, and for what reasons.\r\n\r\nA sedentary person who does not exercise will not burn through muscle glycogen reserves (think of this as energy or carbohydrates), which are really only used for high intensity muscular contractions (hence the name).\r\n\r\nSo inactive individuals do not need to worry about replenishing these stores with the ADA-recommended carbohydrate levels. In other words, if you donâ€™t exercise your carbohydrate needs are much less.\r\n\r\nIf youâ€™re inactive, you really only need to worry about providing adequate carbohydrates to fuel your brain and central nervous system at rest, which is primarily regulated by your liver glycogen stores (80-110g).\r\n\r\nCould you go the super low carb route? Of course, thatâ€™s also an option. But if you do, be aware that it might be associated with ketogenic (low carb)-induced brain fog, grumpiness, depression, insomnia, and low testosterone.\r\n\r\nSo How Many Carbs Should I Eat?\r\nAn effective low-carb, but non-ketogenic diet, can be accomplished with roughly 100 to 125 grams of carbs a day from unlimited, non-starchy vegetables and a few pieces of whole fruit. No rice or starch is necessary.\r\n\r\nBut hereâ€™s the key point: 100 to 125 grams of carbohydrates does not mean eating no carbohydrates. It just means that your demands are less, and your carb sources are best reserved for fruits and veggies. Can you eat other carb sources and stay within that carb range and still be healthy? Of course. But you might lose out on some other nutritional benefits.\r\n\r\nHigh carbohydrate intakes, on the other hand, are more appropriate for gym rats and athletes that engage in intense muscle tearing, glycogen depleting training sessions.\r\n\r\nWhen you exercise, your body undergoes the cyclical depletion (through training) and repletion (through targeted starch intake) of muscle glycogen stores. That can take a lot more than 100 grams because beyond what supports the liver, your muscles can store about 300 to 600 grams of carbohydrates.\r\n\r\nIf you drive your car around and empty the gas tank, you need to fill it back up to keep it functioning properly. So in those cases, on the days that you train, depending on your bodyweight and goals you might need several hundred grams of carbohydrates to help your body recover and grow.\r\n\r\nStep 2: Why Should You Eat Starchy Carbs?\r\nBy now, I hope you understand that the only reason you need starch is for the single, sole purpose of obtaining the high-powered glucose molecules within that food, which in turn can be used to:\r\n\r\n1. Fuel anaerobic activity (think weight lifting) via glycolysis (the breakdown of carbohydrates). \r\n\r\n2. Restock glycogen (carb stores) that has been depleted through hard training. \r\n\r\n3. Trigger an anabolic (muscle-building) environment that offsets, and hopefully exceeds, the initial catabolic stress brought on by intense training.\r\n\r\nThe moral of the story is that for people who exercise, itâ€™s the glucose chains in starchy carbs that really matter, not all of the additional compounds that sometimes come along with them.\r\n\r\nIf you are eating starchy carbs for any other reason than to obtain those glucose chains, I believe you are eating them for the wrong reasons. Thatâ€™s a lot of fancy science talk, so hereâ€™s what you really need to know. These are bad reasons to choose certain carb sources:\r\n\r\nI choose â€œxâ€ carb because it is high in protein\r\nGrain proteins are of inferior quality and bioavailability than animal proteins.  You should be getting the majority of your protein needs from high quality animal sources.  Any protein in grain foods is incidental, not necessary. The obvious exception: If you follow a vegetarian or vegan diet, this rule changes.\r\n\r\nI choose â€œyâ€ carb because it is high in fiber\r\nFiber is invaluable for overall health, but I believe you are better off getting the bulk of your fiber, so to speak, from natural plant sources â€” like fruits and veggies â€” rather than man-made cardboard â€” like fiber twigs and sawdust.\r\n\r\nI choose â€œzâ€ carb because it is low glycemic\r\nChronic elevations in insulin can definitely be problematic, and can lead to a host of diseases including diabetes and Man-Boob-itis. But short-term (acute) elevations under certain metabolic conditions can be highly beneficial to the athlete. Insulin transports amino acids and glucose into the muscle cell to initiate the recovery process from training.\r\n\r\nYou should indeed choose low glycemic fruits and vegetables the majority of the time (and if sedentary, all of the time). But a higher glycemic food â€“ oh I donâ€™t know, like white rice â€“ can work magic in a targeted, post-workout recovery period.\r\n\r\nStep #3: Choose the Right\r\nStarchy Carb Source\r\nHereâ€™s the real reason why carbs get such a bad reputation: Up to 50 percent of the carbohydrate intake in the typical American diet is in the form of high fructose corn syrup and sugar. This often serves as the â€œcontrolâ€ group in most studies.\r\n\r\nSo when people say carbs are bad, theyâ€™re usually just talking about eating lots of sugar. But thatâ€™s not really fair to every other food that also is labeled a carbohydrate.\r\n\r\nWhen compared to a typical American diet, the low carb diet is going to look like the undisputed world champ. However, when compared to a good carb-based diet that is low in sugar, refined foods, and gluten (like the â€œJapanese Dietâ€), the results are very different.\r\n\r\nIn Japan, diabetes and obesity rates were never greater than 3 percent of the population pre-1991. If carbs in general were the enemy, with their high starch intake via rice and sweet potatoes, the Japanese would be the fattest, most diabetic and unhealthy population on the planet. However, this was not the case.\r\n\r\nCondemning all carbs as evil and cutting them across the board, regardless of the type or individual metabolic situation, is an uniformed approach.'),

So it should come as no surprise that any diet attempting to completely purge carbohydrates â€” or anyone suggesting all carbs are evil â€” needs to take a step back, cut out the dogma, and take a hard look at reality, personal preference, and make sure weâ€™re all clear on the real rules of carbohydrates.\r\n\r\nFew popular diets ever suggest to â€œeat more carbs,â€ so why is it that carbs get such a bad reputation? Thereâ€™s a huge gap between understanding foods that have healthy qualities (think â€œmicronutrientsâ€ like vitamins and minerals) and foods that play a part in weight loss. While foods are digested differently, almost any food can be part of a weight loss plan.\r\n\r\nItâ€™s why weâ€™ve seen esteemed scientists eat a diet primarily of Twinkies to prove how dropping pounds can be turned into a mathematical equation.\r\n\r\nThatâ€™s not an invitation to begin an all snack food diet. Instead, itâ€™s context to finding the balance between eating foods you enjoyâ€” like rice or potatoes â€” instead of having to follow a bland, frustrating diet that you inevitably abandon out of frustration and extreme hangriness. [Hangry (noun): that feeling of hungry that drives you to extreme levels of anger and/or becoming whiny.]\r\n\r\nSo letâ€™s stop with the nonsense. Not all carbs are bad. At the same time, certain types of carbs can make it harder for you to look and feel the way you want, especially when you factor in your exercise behaviors.\r\n\r\nCarb Resistance: Itâ€™s Real (And Imagined)\r\nThe biggest carb threat can be pinpoint to those with the â€œmy body hates carbsâ€ gene. These are the individuals that appear allergic to carbs because, well, they are. Gluten sensitivity, food allergies, and inflammation make foods like grains and bread a common enemy.\r\n\r\nEven if you donâ€™t suffer from any of those problems, you might find that when you eat more carbs you feel bloated and fat â€” especially when those carbs come from sugar, candy, or lots of processed crap. (Think of foods that are manufactured and donâ€™t have the best nutritional profileâ€¦instant mac and cheese, anyone?)'),

(This is also why I like creating both training and diet plans because it allows me to control as much of your environment as possible.)\r\n\r\n2) Training volume: Total number of reps and sets you perform for each workout.\r\n\r\n3) Target bodyweight (TBW): TBW is a measure of targeted amount of lean body mass (LBM) plus a margin of safety. Using TBW allows us to set macros based on the maintenance requirements of the goal, rather than simply just selecting some arbitrary adjustment to calories. More importantly, it adjusts so that youâ€™re eating for the body you want, not the body you have. \r\n\r\n4) Body fat (current) and body fat goal: I want to know your baseline and your goal body fat. I care about body fat percentage much more than scale weight. And your starting point will make a big difference on how aggressive you can be in attacking your goal, especially if focusing on fat loss.\r\n\r\nObviously, the volume, current and goal weight, current and goal body fat will differ by individuals. If someone is leaner Iâ€™m going to make sure they eat more carbs. Why? Because a primary focus is always going to be making sure you feel good and can train at the highest intensity possible. Same goes if they have a higher training volume.\r\n\r\nIf someone just wants to focus on body recomp (dropping body fat percentage) youâ€™ll see fewer carbs and higher protein, but Iâ€™ll never start carbs super low. Thatâ€™s a common mistake.\r\n\r\nCarbs for Fat Loss and Muscle Gain\r\nCarbs should be manipulated when progress stalls, not just started low to manipulate body weight.\r\n\r\nYou see, adjusting carbs can create an illusion of results. Drop all your carbs and the scale will change because of water weight fluctuations. But a rapid drop could only lead to even more rapid gains (when you add back carbs) or long-term frustration when you progress falls flat after just a few weeks.\r\n\r\nDo you want to trick your scale or transform your body? Thatâ€™s the real question, and the answer is taking a more progressive approach to carb manipulation.\r\n\r\nThe first step should be finding the maximum amount of carbs you can eat and still lose body fat. From there, then you want to make small adjustments to how many carbs you eat to prevent plateau. In some cases, you can even increase carb intake and still see your weight decrease. Why? Because thereâ€™s nothing about carbs that is inherently fatty. Vegetables are carbs, so this only makes sense if you think about it.\r\n\r\nSuper low carbs can also cause a drop in libido. No cake or sex? I think Iâ€™ll pass.\r\n\r\nIf you want to lose body fat and gain significant weight (not just lean body mass), I tend to utilize carb cycling. Put simply, this is a way of making sure you eat more carbs on the days you exercise and fewer on the days you donâ€™t. This is as much about physiology as it is about psychology. You might be hungrier on days you exercise, so why not allow for more food on those days?\r\n\r\nFor Best Results: Emphasize\r\nWorkouts, Not Carb Depletion\r\nLike any good health plan, my formula is meant as a guide, not a hard rule. Within each of those variables there are many factors that allow for adjustments to proteins, fats, and carbs in a few different ways. And one of those ways is considering the foods that a client loves or enjoys.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day, the macros I recommend are completely driven by your goals. The worst thing I can do for any client is prescribe a diet that makes them miserable or removes all foods they love.\r\n\r\nYou want to know why so many diets fail? Itâ€™s a matter of consistency.  Not to mention, we know that many diets work.\r\n\r\nThatâ€™s why I try to make sure carb amounts remain a little higher so that we promote a â€œtraining effect.â€\r\n\r\nI want all my clients to crush their workouts and feel great. That means eating carbs to keep you performing at your highest level or just simply enjoying your plan to prevent burnout or diet frustration. Never forget that the biggest â€œsecretâ€ in fitness is personalization. Thatâ€™s when the real magic occurs.\r\n\r\nFrom there, the rest is touch and go. I create the formulas to establish a baseline, but if you donâ€™t respond itâ€™s my job is to adjust and make sure you see progress.              ');

If you have examples of people that eat wheat and arenâ€™t fat, then we canâ€™t apply the rule universally.\r\n\r\nAnd thatâ€™s the issue with wheat and weight loss: any book or program that highlights one food as the root of all problems is oversimplifying how weight gain works. \r\n\r\nHaving abs doesnâ€™t make you healthy. But they are a pretty good indictor that youâ€™re not resistant to fat loss.\r\n\r\nThis picture shows me on a diet where I ate cheesecake once per week. Yes, I was counting macros. And, sure, about 80 to 90 percent of what I ate was in the form of vegetables, fruits, proteins. Did I mention I also ate grains every day?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBy this association, I should conclude that adding cheesecake to your diet once per week results in abs, right?\r\n\r\nObviously that sounds insane and isnâ€™t true. But itâ€™s the same style of reasoning that leads a researcher like Dr. Davis to say, â€œI have clients who removed wheat and lost weight. Wheat must be the problem.â€\r\n\r\nThe point here is not that removing wheat is ineffective. Instead itâ€™s that we canâ€™t definitively draw a cause-and-effect conclusion that wheat causes weight gain.\r\n\r\nNot only because the wheat hypothesis lacks proof to suggest that with certainty, but also because there are far too many case studies of people who do eat wheat and can lose weight.\r\n\r\nTake the picture above. During that time of the above picture, this was my diet.\r\n\r\nScreen Shot 2015-03-17 at 10.05.12 AM\r\n\r\nAs you can see, wheat and grains were a prominent part of what I consumed every day. Eventually I achieved sub 10-percent body fat following this plan. And itâ€™s not because I did anything special or removed any particular food.\r\n\r\nI ate well, I exercised hard, and I was extremely patient with the process.\r\n\r\nThatâ€™s not to say that people donâ€™t have wheat allergies or sensitivities. Those are real and can be problematic.\r\n\r\nGut health can play a role in weight loss, and we continue to research and learn about the microbiome. And I do believe that many people can benefit from removing or limiting grains. \r\n\r\nBut that does not mean grains cause weight gain or prevent you from dropping fat.\r\n\r\nWhether itâ€™s wheat, or gluten, or dairy, or carbs, or fat, the finger-pointing at the â€œcauseâ€ of weight gain must end.\r\n\r\nI also have many clients who wanted to eat wheat and were terrified about removing some of their favorite foods. We made sure that their diets were not devoid of carb sources. Here are their â€œwheat bellies.â€                                    '),

But one editorial request for clarity turned into another for additional research, turned into a game with one agenda: no desire to post an article that clearly opposes a vested interest in a popular book.At Born Fitness, we have one agenda: look at information objectively, translate information, and help you figure out how to apply it to your life. This post is an honest, balanced review on popular diet methods, or as most people think of it: how to lose belly fat. Thatâ€™s why we worked with Dr. Mike Israetel, a professor of exercise science at Temple University, to review what science really reveals about weight loss, and challenges a popular opinion on weight gain. Whether you agree or disagree with the ideas and research shared, itâ€™s important that open discussion is not censored. -AB\r\n\r\nMOST STUDIES SIMPLY DO NOT DEMONSTRATE A DETECTABLE EFFECT OF THE GLYCEMIC INDEX ON WEIGHT GAIN OR LOSS.\r\n\r\nIn a recent interview with the New York Times, Harvard nutrition professor Dr. David Ludwig previewed some of the basics of his new book, Always Hungry, which proposes a solution to the problems of obesity that plague much of the western world today.\r\n\r\nWhile many of his ideas seem rational and justified, too much of his thinking seems to run counter to the best current understandings of most other experts in the field of nutrition, health, and obesity. Hereâ€™s an inside look at Ludwigâ€™s claims based on his New York Times article, and what we know about weight gain and fat loss. \r\n\r\nThe Glycemic Index and Weight\r\nLoss: The Broken Model\r\nThe claim: â€œIn his new book, â€œAlways Hungry?â€ Ludwig argues that the primary driver of obesity today is not an excess of calories per se, but an excess of high glycemic foods like sugar, refined grains, and other processed carbohydrates.â€\r\n\r\nBehind the Science: There are several problematic elements with the claim that high glycemic index (GI) foods are mostly to blame for current obesity rates. The most straightforward are that multiple peer-reviewed research trials on the effects of low vs. high glycemic index foods on weight loss have shown that results are similar.\r\n\r\nWhile some studies show that high GI foods affect weight loss negatively and might help cause weight gain, most of the studies show no such effects. Thatâ€™s right, most studies simply do not demonstrate a detectable effect of the glycemic index on weight gain or loss.\r\n\r\nEven if we assume that high GI foods are a big part of the problem, this leaves most of our worst criminals on the streets, so to speak. Cookies, ice cream, pizza, burgers, shakes, potato chips and candy bars are almost all low GI foods. How can this be with all that sugar and those processed carbs they are loaded with?\r\n\r\nYou see, the presence of fat lowers the glycemic index of any food. The more fat, the lower the GI, even if thereâ€™s lots of sugar too.\r\n\r\nThatâ€™s why brown rice has a GI of about 50 (out of 100), but premium ice cream can have a GI under 40. Are we really ready to claim that brown rice is worse for obesity than ice cream? If we accept one of the central concepts of the â€œinsulin hypothesisâ€ as undeniable, then we have to apply the principle equally for all foods, meaning ice cream is good for weight loss.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, the relationship between insulin, the glycemic index, and obesity is complicated, but also overstated. Without an excess of calories, all the high-GI food in the world wonâ€™t make you fat.\r\n\r\nThatâ€™s not to say insulin isnâ€™t a contributing factor to weight loss and weight gain. The study of obesity has made it very clear that itâ€™s a complex disease.\r\n\r\nThere might be a small role for insulin to play in contributing obesity, but something being a small contributor is not nearly the same thing as it being the primary cause. Itâ€™s much more likely that tasty, high-calorie foods, such as ice cream, are just much easier to overeat than unprocessed or naturally sweetened foods, and thatâ€™s a primary reason why diets high in junk food cause weight gain\r\n\r\nMetabolism and Calories-In, Calories-Out\r\nThe claim: â€œSimply cutting back on calories as weâ€™ve been told actually makes the situation worse. Our body responds by increasing hunger and slowing metabolism.â€\r\n\r\nBehind the Science: Itâ€™s absolutely true that cutting back on calories slows your metabolism and can increase hunger. But slow (1% weight loss per week) and steady reductions in eating, combined with increases in activity and exercise have a very small effect on increasing hunger and slowing the metabolism.\r\n\r\nIn fact, consider the following scenario to help understand weight loss, and how food selection is not the only way to create change.\r\n\r\nLetâ€™s say you take someone who is 250 pounds and have them lose 10 percent of their weight and then completely take a break for their fat loss plan. In this scenario, the person would now be 225 pounds after a few months on a plan.\r\n\r\nAfter the break, the subjectâ€™s metabolism would speed back up to its normal levels for their current body weight and hunger cravings would return to normal.\r\n\r\nThis re-setting of the body weight set point is something Ludwig discusses, but it can be done with planned weight loss breaks, and not just with glycemic index reduction and special food selection. None of this is very controversial in the study of obesity.\r\n\r\nThe big question is: how do we keep people at that new weight or perhaps even get them lower?\r\n\r\nResearch has shown that after people leave weight loss studies and are no longer monitored or told what to eat, most (in many cases exceeding 90%) will return to their previous weights over time, and many will go up even higher.\r\n\r\nAnd hereâ€™s maybe the most important consideration: this happens with essentially every single kind of diet thatâ€™s ever been studied, and low glycemic â€œnatural foodsâ€ diets are no exception.\r\n\r\nLeft to their own devices, most obese people will get right back to making the kinds of choices that lead to weight regain.\r\n\r\nThe big question in obesity research is not how to lose weightâ€¦that we know. Itâ€™s how to keep it off in the real world, even without special metabolic slowdowns or hunger cravings to account for.\r\n\r\nBlood Sugar and Weight Gain\r\nThe claim: â€œWe think of obesity as a state of excess, but itâ€™s really more akin to a state of starvation. If the fat cells are storing too many calories, the brain doesnâ€™t have access to enough to make sure that metabolism runs properly.â€\r\n\r\nBehind the Science: Overweight and obese people have higher, not lower levels of blood sugar and higher, not lower levels of blood lipids, even when theyâ€™re fasting. To say that the brain is lacking in nutrients in those with higher body fat levels is not simply to make a misstatement or an exaggeration, but itâ€™s the exact opposite of the truth.'),
(28, 'January-26-2019 07:51:47', 'WHAT IS THE KETO DIET?', 'Gymnastics', 'jazeb', 'p7.jfif', 'Carbs are out. Fat is in. At least thatâ€™s the case if you believe the ketogenic diet. Claims that the keto diet can somehow trigger superhero-level exercise performance and fat-loss have grown so loud that itâ€™s hard to believe the eating approach was originally designed as a way to treat epileptic seizures in children.\r\n\r\nBut then, taking your body into ketosis â€” the process by which the body runs on fat because you donâ€™t have enough carbs/glucose â€” is a rich resource for the seemingly unbelievable. This is, after all, a dieting method that requires you to purchase special test strips to examine your urine in order to confirm if you have â€œachievedâ€ ketosis. (Yes, seriously.)\r\n\r\nSo is the keto diet effective? Yes and no.\r\n\r\nTHE CLAIMS ABOUT KETO SUPERIORITY FOR FAT LOSS AND MUSCLE GAIN ARE SIGNIFICANTLY INFLATED.\r\n\r\nBut that doesnâ€™t mean the diet is without value.\r\n\r\nTo help you determine if the keto diet is the right approach for you, we dig into your biggest keto diet questionsâ€”and some you probably hadnâ€™t even thought about asking. In the end, should you decide that going keto is best for you, youâ€™ll at least know how to do it properly (most people donâ€™t), understand what itâ€™s really doing to your body (ditto), and be aware of the risks involved.\r\n\r\nWhat is a ketogenic diet?\r\nIn a traditional ketogenic diet, you eat 80 percent of your daily calories from fat. The remaining 20 percent is divvied up between protein and carbohydratesâ€”but most of it protein. Typically, carb intake is capped at 20 grams per day, or less than what youâ€™ll find in a single apple, according to Andy Galpin, Ph.D., C.S.C.S., C.P.T., associate professor of kinesiology and director of the Biochemistry & Molecular Exercise Physiology Lab at California State University, Fullerton.\r\n\r\nThis number is far lower than what youâ€™ll find with most low-carb diets, which generally max out carb intake at about 45 percent of daily calories, according to a review from Tulane University. For someone following a 2,000-calorie diet, that works out to as much as 225 grams per day.\r\n\r\nBut, donâ€™t forget the most important part â€” itâ€™s not the low carbs that surprises most people. After all, keto is known as the low-carb diet. What you need to remember is that the ketogenic diet is also surprisingly low in protein.\r\n\r\nWhy? As youâ€™ll learn, taking your body into ketosis means having your body run on fat for fuel, and protein can be converted into glucose in your body. That means you need to keep protein levels lower to truly establish a state of ketosis.\r\n\r\nWhy do ketogenic diets go so low with carbs?\r\nBacon is allowed on a keto diet.\r\n\r\nCarbs and glycogen (or carbs stored in the liver and muscles) are the bodyâ€™s preferred and most efficient energy source. Once you deplete them, your body must find other energy sources.\r\n\r\nWhen you cut carbs so drastically â€” as one does on a keto diet â€” you can put the body in a state of ketosis. What does that actually mean? Your liver is forced to convert fat into fatty acids and ketones â€” compounds the body can use to produce ATP, a.k.a. energy, Galpin explains.\r\n\r\nItâ€™s this process that truly separates the ketogenic diet from other low-carb approaches such as Atkins, and why the diet revolves around such a high intake of dietary fat: without it, your body cannot produce the ketones needed to keep you up and running.\r\n\r\nTo determine whether the body has truly entered a state of ketosis, youâ€™d need to test yourself for high levels of ketones, Galpin notes. Thatâ€™s why people who go keto have to urinate on at-home test strips.'),

Yes, exercise is also extremely important. And even the best diet wonâ€™t offset a lack of physical activity.\r\n\r\nIf the engine is broken, it doesnâ€™t matter what type of fuel you add to the machine.\r\n\r\nBut if the fuel is terrible, your body still wonâ€™t function the way you want.\r\n\r\nBetween fears of high protein diets, high fat diets, and really any type of carbohydrate, eating has become an overcomplicated mess that creates more stress than needed.\r\n\r\nItâ€™s time to change that mindset while simultaneously changing the way your body looks.\r\n\r\nUse this guide to understand what your body needs, and why you donâ€™t have to frustratingly avoid certain foods that you want as part of your healthy living plan.\r\n\r\nCarbohydrates: The Misunderstood One\r\nCarbohydrates seem to be the focus of most diets you read about (especially fat-loss diets), so it makes sense to start here.\r\n\r\nCarbs have taken a real beating in the media ever since some guy named Atkins (you may have heard of him) decided we werenâ€™t allowed to eat doughnuts anymore. (Prior to this we were allowed to eat doughnuts, but they had to be reduced fat; this made us feel better about ourselves.)\r\n\r\nAll joking aside, carbs have a bad reputation, or at least a worse one than they deserve.\r\n\r\nCarbs come in a variety of forms. Some are good for you, and some are bad. The bad ones are usually highly processed and could barely be considered food other than the fact that theyâ€™re edible. They may be delicious, but theyâ€™re also the result of some crazy scientific processes.\r\n\r\nOf course, if you process the crap out of anything, it reaches a point where it just isnâ€™t healthy anymore. This doesnâ€™t mean carbs are evil and to blame for the obesity epidemicâ€”it just means that eating processed foods that are loaded with sugars and highly palatable are great at making people fat.\r\n\r\nWhy? Because we end up eating far too much of it. The reality is, your diet can include some processed carbs too, as long as itâ€™s a minimal amount of the overall amount you eat.\r\n\r\nCarbs 101: Simple vs. Complex\r\n\r\nCarbohydrates are made up of sugar molecules, which your body breaks down into fuel, especially when youâ€™re working hard. Sugars, starches, and fiber are all basic forms of the carbohydrate.\r\n\r\nThere are two main types of carbohydrates: simple and complex.\r\n\r\nWe could also mention fibrous carbs that you can find in foods like green veggies, lettuce, cabbage, broccoli, sprouts, spinach, cauliflower, peppers, cucumbers, zucchini â€¦ buuuut we wonâ€™t.\r\n\r\nFor the purposes of this discussion of carbs, we only want to touch on stuff that is probably causing issues with your weight. This doesnâ€™t mean that these foods donâ€™t count. They do.\r\n\r\nBut I donâ€™t think a primary cause of weight gain is eating too many vegetables. And after coaching literally thousands of people, itâ€™s become very clear that eating more veggies has always been a good thing.\r\n\r\nQuite simply, eating vegetables allows you to eat more. And by eating more, youâ€™re less hungry. And when you consider that hunger is strongly associated weight weight gain, winning war on hangry is half the battle.\r\n\r\nSimple Carbohydrates\r\n\r\nIn the most basic sense, simple carbohydrates include table sugar, syrup, and soda. Most of the time, these carbs should be avoided (exceptions include cheat days or small daily indulgences, which should be included in any plan) and are usually the â€œbad carbsâ€ that fitness pros talk about. Also included on this list are things like candy, cake, beer, and cookies. In other words, the best ones.\r\n\r\nComplex Carbohydrates\r\n\r\nComplex carbohydrates include oatmeal, apples, cardboard, and peas.\r\n\r\nFor a long time, people believed that complex carbohydrates were universally better for you than simple carbohydrates, but that isnâ€™t always the case.\r\n\r\nYou see, your body takes both complex and simple carbohydrates and tries to break them down into useable sugar energy to fuel your muscles and organs. Itâ€™s not the type of carbohydrate that really matters, but how quickly your body can break it down and how much it will spike your blood glucose levels.\r\n\r\nItâ€™s not as simple as dividing complex carbs from simple ones, though. A slightly more sophisticated way to rate carbohydrate quality is something called the glycemic index (GI).\r\n\r\nThe GI attempts to classify foods by how quickly they break down and how high they boost blood sugar levels.\r\n\r\nFor a while, the GI was all the rage, and people argued that by following a low-GI diet, youâ€™d keep insulin levels in check even while eating more carbs overall.\r\n\r\nThis has turned out to be only partially true. Which is to say that while itâ€™s probably better to eat low GI foods than high ones, there probably wonâ€™t be a tremendous difference in your waistline if youâ€™re still eating your weight in sweet potatoes instead of Cheerios.\r\n\r\nNeither low-carb diets nor low-GI diets are a magic pill for fat loss; the main thing is to eat the right amount of healthy foods that fuel metabolism, which in turn will help you burn fat.\r\n\r\nThe important thing to remember is that your body needs carbs, even if some of the fad diets tell you otherwise. This becomes even more important if youâ€™re performing intense exercise. Without carbohydrates, your body will begin to break down your muscle tissue to fuel your body, which will sabotage your efforts.\r\n\r\nCarb lovers lament low-carb diets, and anti-carb crusaders posit that you can avoid carbs for the most part and still do well.\r\n\r\nIt is true that low-carb diets offer many health benefits, but as Iâ€™ve stated before, low carb doesnâ€™t mean no carb.\r\n\r\nJust as important, those health benefits donâ€™t mean low carb is strategically better for fat loss. Research published in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition dropped a bomb when it compared a lower carb diet to a higher carb diet and discovered no significant difference on fat loss, metabolism, or muscle retention.\r\n\r\nYour Eating Tip: Ultimately, the number of carbs you eat is going to be highly based on personal preference, activity levels, and how your body reacts to what you eat. Carb intake should be determine after you prioritize fat and protein levels.'),

YES, COUNTING WORKS, BUT SOMETIMES THE NUMBER CRUNCHING DOES MORE HARM THAN GOOD FROM A PRACTICAL STANDPOINT.\r\n\r\nWhile rule #3 has plenty of exceptions, itâ€™s usually necessary for even the savviest of dieters and fitness pros. Why? Because what we know oftentimes makes it harder for us to accept new information or to question what we already assume as fact.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to building the right diet for you, simply avoiding what didnâ€™t work in the past or blindly following what appears to work now is important (see rule #1), but it has many limitations. The biggest of which is understanding that progressing to a new level of success and noticeable results usually means identifying flaws in your current plan, and understanding why what youâ€™re doing might not be the most efficient way to get the job done.\r\n\r\nTo help provide more clarity, use this guide as a starting point for any diet plan you create. It will help you understand what you we know about good diet design, as well as what factors might relate to seeing the most results out of your body.\r\n\r\nThe Macro Question: Does IIFYM Work?\r\nThe undeniable aspect of counting your macros (AKA â€œif it fits your macrosâ€ or IIFYM) is that science is on your side. This is a very good thing if youâ€™re looking for a way to finally jumpstart weight loss frustration or a stagnant muscle building plan.\r\n\r\nThe laws of thermodynamics are very real, so if you receive a good macro plan that understands progressions, how to manipulate the nutrients, and how to factor in types and duration of exercise, then playing by the numbers is a great path to results. If you know what you want to look like or a have a goal weight, use this as your starting point (instead of your current weight). This will allow you to eat towards a goal.\r\n\r\nThat said, macros are not for everyone. Yes, counting works, but sometimes the number crunching does more harm than good from a practical standpoint. Becoming OCD about how much to eat or worrying about being 5 grams â€œoverâ€ on daily carb intake (which, honestly, is not a big deal) is something that is determined by your personality.\r\n\r\nFor some people, creating food templates that allow for â€œserving-sizeâ€ based eating is a style that takes a macro approach without all the math. This means breaking down your meals into types of foods, and then just filling in the gaps with what you want to eat.\r\n\r\nHEREâ€™S WHAT A TEMPLATE SAMPLE COULD LOOK LIKE.\r\nIf youâ€™re not going to count all your proteins, carbs, and fats. however, you still might be best served by a 1-week counting and measuring period that will help you learn portion sizes.\r\n\r\nIf that still feels like too much, start by learning how to measure portion sizes by eyeballing quantities.

Remember me?\r\n\r\nIt gets old, tired, and frustrating. So maybe itâ€™s time you try something new.\r\n\r\nHello, fat loss. Screw you.\r\n\r\nLetâ€™s make one thing clear: Dieting sucks. Iâ€™m not saying dieting doesnâ€™t work (because it does), but the concept is no fun.\r\n\r\nWhether we like it or not, we all follow a diet. So letâ€™s stop focusing on the meaningless word and start fixing what really matters.\r\n\r\nSeeing awesome results.\r\n\r\nI donâ€™t care who you are; this is all that really matters.

You didnâ€™t put the weight on overnight, and it sure isnâ€™t melting off.

When itâ€™s done right, you never find yourself back in that familiar place.\r\n\r\nWeight Loss: Without the Hype\r\nThe general question isnâ€™t how will I lose weight or what do I need to do. Instead itâ€™s, â€œHow will this time be any different?â€\r\n\r\nThatâ€™s because youâ€™ve become conditioned to expect diets to fail.\r\n\r\nMuch of the diet and fitness advice you need is overplayed, overhyped, and inaccurate. You are taking pieces of information and trying to create a Frankenstein approach to your body.\r\n\r\nThat crap doesnâ€™t work.\r\n\r\nAt some point you start making excuses because of constant roadblocks: Bad genetics, a hectic work schedule, and the typical Sunday football menu of burgers, wings, and beer (the same way the dating excuses line up, Seinfeld-style, like â€œshe eats peas with a fork,â€ â€œsheâ€™s a low-talker,â€ etc.). The reality? The excuses are a bunch of bull. The techniques are filled with half-truths.\r\n\r\nHereâ€™s something most programs donâ€™t tell you: Your body is designed to incinerate the hard-to-lose fat. You know those areas as man boobs, love handles, and thunder thighs.\r\n\r\nBut the real problem is that youâ€™ve been fed a steady diet of misinformation about what your body needs in order to look its best. And radical, dramatic steps are the last things your body needs. You need something more stable and sustainable.\r\n\r\nYour body is the most sophisticated natural machine. It burns calories to help you perform all of your daily tasks, like standing up, thinking, and sleeping.\r\n\r\nThis daily maintenance is called your basal metabolic rate (BMR). Everyone has a BMR, but the bigger you are, the faster your metabolism works. Think about that: The more weight you carry, the better your metabolism.\r\n\r\nOn the surface, that doesnâ€™t make sense. After all, skinny people have better metabolisms, right? Well, not exactly. Think about it another way.\r\n\r\nSay you have two cars, an Audi and a Hummer. Which needs more fuel? The Hummer does, because itâ€™s much larger and has more demands.\r\n\r\nYour body is no different. Everything you do, from powering your heart to helping you move from point A to point B requires energy.\r\n\r\nThatâ€™s why the larger you are, the harder your body needs to work and the more calories you burn.\r\n\r\nYour body wants to be an Audi; you just have to be willing to trade in for a new model.\r\n\r\nSo how do you become leaner? Surprisingly, itâ€™s the small things that really make the biggest differences. And over time, those tiny changes add up to a lean, toned body.\r\n\r\nConsider this a refreshing outlook on your transformation: Your metabolism isnâ€™t holding you back, and your body isnâ€™t hardwired to look a certain way. You can control your ability to lose weight. Simple, small adjustments to your diet, exercise, and other behaviors will make a surprisingly big difference and transform your body.\r\n\r\nIf you drop the stubborn act and change your strategy based on a few simple guidelines, you can literally switch your body into a fitter, healthier modeâ€”it will burn more calories, build more muscle, and youâ€™ll look amazing.'),

You inevitably stumble upon theories about inflammation, food allergies, not enough â€œgoodâ€ fats, a lack of superfoods, how eating breakfast is the problemâ€¦or is it avoiding breakfast and fasting?\r\n\r\nThe list goes on and on. Youâ€™re stuck in plateau mode, so just about any option starts to sound good and then you make a choice that still doesnâ€™t lead to change. (This might explain your fexperiences with most diet books.)\r\n\r\nThe problem isnâ€™t that youâ€™re making changes, itâ€™s that the adjustments and misleading solutions are overwhelming, confusing, and oftentimes inaccurate.\r\n\r\nMost fat loss hype is just another empty promise that is more likely to leave you frustrated with your body rather than satisfied with your results. Instead of relying on scapegoats â€” like meal frequency, single categories of foods, or anything else that flies in the face of science â€” a more effective approach is rethinking why your previous attempts didnâ€™t work.\r\n\r\nBehind the â€œLose Weight Fastâ€\r\nSolutions: Seeing is Not Believing\r\nYouâ€™ve probably heard a lot of reasons why you gain weight or struggle to drop pounds, these include:\r\n\r\nYou donâ€™t eat enough meals in the day to help your metabolism\r\nYou skip breakfast, which means you donâ€™t â€œturn onâ€ your metabolism to start the day\r\nYou donâ€™t do intermittent fasting, which means your hormones are messed up (Yes, I wrote a book on intermittent fasting; while itâ€™s a good technique, my thoughts on how it benefits your body have changed)\r\nYou eat too late at night and those calories are more likely to become fat\r\nYou eat â€œstarchyâ€ carbs, which are transformed into sugar\r\nYou eat white foods, such as white rice, which make you fat\r\nYou eat gluten or non-organic food sources, which pollute your body\r\nAll of these are behavioral choices you can makeâ€¦if they fit your lifestyle and feel sustainable. But donâ€™t be fooled: none of these are reasons why you gain weight or canâ€™t lose fat.\r\n\r\nYou can eat meals at night, enjoy gluten, and never fast a day in your life, and your body is still capable of changing.\r\n\r\nYou must learn to separate technique from causes, differentiate strategy from roadblock, and science from science fiction.\r\n\r\nInstead of searching for quick answers for your â€œlose weight fastâ€ goals, itâ€™s more effective to ask why your current approach has failed to produce the results you want.\r\n\r\nHere are four common weight loss mistakes and alternate solutions that can set you on the right path. None of these approaches are extreme or set unrealistic expectations. What they will do is help you understand why you havenâ€™t seen changes in the past, and why this time â€” with a more strategic approachâ€“your results can be different.\r\n'),
(33, 'March-11-2020 06:50:01', 'ARE YOU OVERTRAINING?', 'Bootcamp', 'jazeb', 'p2.jfif', 'How do you know if you are pushing\r\ntoo hard during your workouts?\r\nOvertraining is a real phenomenon. It is possible to train so much that you break your body down rather than build it up. But most people never come close to â€œrealâ€ overtraining, which is highlighted (lowlighted?) by physical breakdowns that are hard to ignore. This isnâ€™t muscle soreness or having some bad days in the gym.\r\n\r\nHere are 7 common symptoms\r\nof overtraining, they include:\r\nIncrease in resting heart rate and blood pressure\r\nInsomnia-like symptoms and trouble sleeping\r\nStomach disturbances\r\nConsistent low energy and bad mood\r\nChanges in personality and mood\r\nDecreased self-esteem and motivation\r\nFeelings of sadness and apathy\r\n\r\nWhile that article gives a great breakdown of how to set up your training, it doesnâ€™t cover how you determine the fine line between intensity and insanity. So if youâ€™re worried about pushing too hard, Mike Robertson has the answer. Mike (one of the top strength coaches in the U.S.) examines the different ways to evaluate the intensity of your workouts.\r\n\r\nThey can be broken down into a few options:\r\nOption 1: A self-analysis technique known as RPR/RPE, or â€œrate of perceived recoveryâ€ and â€œrate of perceived exertion.â€ The RPR scale is how you feel coming into a training session â€” how well you slept, how tired/sore you feel, etc.\r\n\r\nThe RPE rates how heavy/how hard things feel once you start working out. And as youâ€™ll see in Mikeâ€™s post, he evaluates it by regularly asking clients questions about how each move feels throughout the workout. Hereâ€™s an example:\r\n\r\nRPE of 10 â€“ Max effort/limit lift. This is either one heckuva grinder, or they flat out miss a lift.\r\nRPE of 9 â€“ Heavy lift, but one rep left in the tank.\r\nRPE of 8 â€“ Heavy(ish) lift, but two reps left in the tank.\r\nRPE of 7 â€“ Moderate weight, multiple reps left in the tank\r\nOption 2: But letâ€™s say you donâ€™t trust yourself to make subjective measurements. You want data. Well, there are some tests you can use that will put some numbers to your physical preparedness.\r\n\r\nFor example, the vertical jump is a fairly accurate predictor of how fatigued you are (see study here). If your gym has one of those jump height sticks (yâ€™know, these things), you can use that as a self-assessment tool. Jump before your workout/after your warm-up. If you are at, or above, your usual total, then youâ€™re likely ready to go.\r\n\r\nIf youâ€™re several inches below, then youâ€™re more tired than you think and may want to scale the session back â€” or even make it an active recovery day.\r\n\r\nOption 3: If you donâ€™t like jumping, but still want data, no problem. A less obvious way to test your readiness is a simple hand dynamometer, which is a tool that measures hand strength. Studies show that hand strength is a reliable indicator of strength on a given day (example here).\r\n\r\nAnd if youâ€™re squeezing and squeezing but several points lower than usual, youâ€™re more fatigued than you know.\r\n\r\nHow to make use of all of this?\r\nWhen you get to the gym and start doing your â€œworking setsâ€ (not your warmup), stop and assess how you feel. The weight on the bar might be similar to prior workouts, but how you feel is likely different. And that is your body trying to give you helpful information to make the most of your session.\r\n\r\nInstead of sticking to your exact plan, if the weight feels â€œheavierâ€ than usual and youâ€™re exhausted, you can still get in a great workout without grinding away unnecessarily. As you workout, this is the holy grail of feeling in control.\r\n\r\nPush harder when your body says you can, and easy up when you know how to recognize that youâ€™re a little overworked. Itâ€™s an approach thatâ€™s more likely to keep you consistently in the gym, feeling good, and making improvements.'),

To continue the example weâ€™ve been using here, it would be 2,600 calories total minus 800 calories (protein) and 900 calories (fat), leaving you with 900 calories for carbs. Divide that by 4 and you get 225 calories of carbs per day.\r\n\r\nWhile the length of your maintenance phase can vary, youâ€™d want to approach it as if it were something you could do for several months or even years. Why? Because â€” again â€” you want this to be your new normal.\r\n\r\nYou want to think of building muscle not in terms of days and weeks, but months and years. The biggest, most muscular people in the world are the ones who show up for training, again and again, for years on end.                                                                 ');
